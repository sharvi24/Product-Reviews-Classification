Kids need lots of practice to master the ABC's, and this puzzle provides an enjoyable reinforcing tool. Its visual richness helps non-readers and readers alike to remember word associations, and the wealth of cleverly chosen objects surrounding each letter promote language development. The riddle included multiplies the fun of assembling this colorful puzzle. For another great Briarpatch puzzle, check out I Spy Blocks. END\n",

              "4452  My experiences with health and energy bars have been mixed. Most of the ones I've tried are pricey, taste terrible, and make me feel like I've swallowed powdered cement. So, I was cautious about Pure Bar. My general view, based on experience, is that the healthier and more \"organic\" it is, the worse it's going to be and this one is jam-packed with things like organic dates, organic cashews, organic rice protein concentrate, and other organic healthy stuff--so it couldn't possibly be delicious, right? Wrong. I was pleasantly surprised after the first bite hit my taste buds. These things are really good! Unlike most health bars I've tried, these are chewy and moist--not hard and dry. I don't have to wash this down with a drink in order to get it from my throat to my stomach, and there's no nasty aftertaste. And, the price is definitely reasonable! I'll be buying more of these for sure.  \n",

When I think \"chocolate and coconut\" I think Mounds bar, and that's exactly what this tastes like, if you took a Mounds bar and replaced it with a giant hunk of dirt. This is no way tastes like chocolate. Stay away unless you actually like the taste of carob (which is fine, they just shouldn't call it chocolate), or you're one of those people who think Diet Coke tastes at all like regular Coke, in which case you clearly have no sense of taste anyway, so have at it.  \n",

I am also into healthy food so the Luna Bars are a good compromise. Don't let the fact you're a guy stop you- these are marketed towards women (because of the soy craze), there's nothing here that can harm you.The Dulce flavor is among my favorite flavor (along with Nutz/Pecan and Dreams), having a sort of caramel/\"rice crispy treat\" taste. Only problem is that I like this flavor so much I tend to eat too many, and they have alot of calories. So don't eat too many unless you are a very active person.The Clif line are a great help to those of us with health issues, and I commend them for their wonderful products.  \n",

They tend to like pizza etc. These protein bars give me the energy and have 20 grams of protein that I need, I am a vegetarian. I find that they also cure my chocolate craving and are good enough for me to consider them my mid afternoon treat. With three children I often do not have time to eat. I would highly recommend them to any person who needs to eat on the run. I have them on auto ship as with a 9 month old, I cannot always get to a store that carries them. The price is very competitive if ordering from Amazon. Believe me, I have checked.  \n",

But if you can eat wheat, I prefer Zone Bars (Mint) better. I bought these after all of the good reviews but when I ate it-it didn't taste like white chocolate at all and the texture is a little gross (sorry). It also is good for fighting hunger, but so are Zone Bars so I think I will stick with them.  "

Email response from the company was WAY faster than expected.(I lost the printed instructions, dropped them an email, and bang. Less than 12 hours later, a .doc appeared in my inbox) Thats customer service...The included instructions could be a little more clear, but a 5 star none the less.Ill even break down the instructions for you.Pee into something, insert strip, wait 5 mins. and...1 line on the strip is a positive2 lines equal a negative.Thats all you need to know.But you should know, im not fat, and i wasnt a \"heavy\" user. But at ONE MONTH Im still testing positive.All those herbal supplements dont work, and the clean out or cover up junk out there is all BS. They now test for cover ups.Well the jury is still out on Niacin. Given to a buddy by an A R M Y recruiter. He turned purple, but he passed.</td>\n",

My milk dried up in less than 2 weeks, and the discomfort was much less while I had it on. It was a life saver!  \n",

Who cant find something to pee in?This is still very easy to use, and very cheap.AND... Email response from the company was WAY faster than expected.(I lost the printed instructions, dropped them an email, and bang. Less than 12 hours later, a .doc appeared in my inbox) Thats customer service...The included instructions could be a little more clear, but a 5 star none the less.Ill even break down the instructions for you.Pee into something, insert strip, wait 5 mins. and...1 line on the strip is a positive2 lines equal a negative.Thats all you need to know.But you should know, im not fat, and i wasnt a \"heavy\" user. But at ONE MONTH Im still testing positive.All those herbal supplements dont work, and the clean out or cover up junk out there is all BS. They now test for cover ups.Well the jury is still out on Niacin. Given to a buddy by an A R M Y recruiter. He turned purple, but he passed.  \n",

              "1567  Mop did not stand up to use. When I called the company to report the issue and return the mop, the company was very difficult to work with and said I had to go back to Amazon for the refund. Amazon said I had to go back to the company. When I emailed the mop company about this, they never responded. In the end, Amazon showed excellent customer service and refunded my money back. Shortly after, I received a call from the mop company stating that their return policy is 30 days, and again not responsive or willing to return the product. Poor customer service. Thank you Amazon for your excellent response and customer service. I will definetely buy through Amazon again, but would not recommend the mop or mop company.  \n",

Some of my studies included neurobiology and I have a lot of meditation experience. As part of my work, I teach meditation workshops and also use biofeedback personally and for education purposes. While I know the basics of neurofeedback, it is not a specialty area. So, using this product was a brand new experience for me. This is not biofeedback as such, but it could be coupled with biofeedback for various purposes.What this equipment does in generate patterns of light that are synchronized with sound. There are also various CDs available that couple the Proteus unit to music. I tried the system in both ways, but got the most out of coupling it with music.The glasses provided with the Proteues are meant to be used while your eyes are closed. They generate very bright light that shines through your eyelids. In EEG work, a light strobe is used in a similar fashion to induce seizures in susceptible people or for other types of study.The theoretical concept behind this type of technology is that one can induce certain brain states characterized by different amplitudes of specific types of brain waves i.e. alpha, beta, theta and delta. Different patterns of brain waves result in different mind states. The product literature also talks about the concept of entrainment where your brain waves synchronize to the light and sound while your brain hemispheres are synchronized or balanced.While I can't speak to the validity of the theory, testing, etc., I could talk about my experience. In short, it was awesome and it certainly seemed to have the ability to induce different states of consciousness including relaxation and euphoria. Because I do biofeedback work, I was curious to couple it with heart rate variability (HRV) and pulse data. In my case, I seemed to reach higher levels of brain/heart coherence. This correlates with being in a relaxed, open and healthy state. That's all you really need to know if the technical language is unfamiliar.As an aesthetic experience, using this unit was simply AWESOME! When I bought it, my expectations weren't that high. However, all of my expectations were exceeded. Because you are wearing glasses that generate the light, it completely fills your visual field. The effect is indescribable. Also, the pulsations of light induce states that are unusual and very pleasant. I found the experience fascinating and I can certainly see how this could be useful for meditation, relaxation and perhaps even pain management. I was having back pain the day I used it and I definitely had less pain afterwards. My feeling of well-being also remained after my session was over.I am a bit surprised that this device is marketed to the general public because there is the possibility that it could induce seizures in some people. The literature and the product description provide warnings that people prone to seizures and on psychotropic medications should NOT use it without consulting with their physicians.I'm guessing that the type of people who are looking at this product are probably interested in meditation, self development and our expansion of consciousness. If this is true, you may be interested inIntegral Life Practice Starter Kit. You can read my review about the details, but it provides a structure for engaging yourself in a variety of practices physical, emotional, mental and spiritual all at the same time to bring about transformation. Ken Wilber is a very reputable author and this kit is well thought out.There are many books on biofeedback and neurobiofeedback as well. For the layperson, it is difficult to know what to choose. If you are serious about this type of technology, however, I would recommendAwakening the Mind PA</td>\n",

However, the massage feature is built into a plastic box within the memory foam. If you apply to much pressure, you feel the platic pressing against your back. I used it about five minutes in the car before I couldn't take it any longer. The batteries and plastic kept pressing into my back. I'm 6 feet tall and about 160 lbs, so I think anyone with a large to medium build would probably agree that the massage feature does more harm than good. As an alternative, I would recommend a lumbar support without the electronic massage feature.</td>\n",

              "2611  I am a former teaching fellow in Physiology and I also have additional graduate education in both biochemistry and psychology. Some of my studies included neurobiology and I have a lot of meditation experience. As part of my work, I teach meditation workshops and also use biofeedback personally and for education purposes. While I know the basics of neurofeedback, it is not a specialty area. So, using this product was a brand new experience for me. This is not biofeedback as such, but it could be coupled with biofeedback for various purposes.What this equipment does in generate patterns of light that are synchronized with sound. There are also various CDs available that couple the Proteus unit to music. I tried the system in both ways, but got the most out of coupling it with music.The glasses provided with the Proteues are meant to be used while your eyes are closed. They generate very bright light that shines through your eyelids. In EEG work, a light strobe is used in a similar fashion to induce seizures in susceptible people or for other types of study.The theoretical concept behind this type of technology is that one can induce certain brain states characterized by different amplitudes of specific types of brain waves i.e. alpha, beta, theta and delta. Different patterns of brain waves result in different mind states. The product literature also talks about the concept of entrainment where your brain waves synchronize to the light and sound while your brain hemispheres are synchronized or balanced.While I can't speak to the validity of the theory, testing, etc., I could talk about my experience. In short, it was awesome and it certainly seemed to have the ability to induce different states of consciousness including relaxation and euphoria. Because I do biofeedback work, I was curious to couple it with heart rate variability (HRV) and pulse data. In my case, I seemed to reach higher levels of brain/heart coherence. This correlates with being in a relaxed, open and healthy state. That's all you really need to know if the technical language is unfamiliar.As an aesthetic experience, using this unit was simply AWESOME! When I bought it, my expectations weren't that high. However, all of my expectations were exceeded. Because you are wearing glasses that generate the light, it completely fills your visual field. The effect is indescribable. Also, the pulsations of light induce states that are unusual and very pleasant. I found the experience fascinating and I can certainly see how this could be useful for meditation, relaxation and perhaps even pain management. I was having back pain the day I used it and I definitely had less pain afterwards. My feeling of well-being also remained after my session was over.I am a bit surprised that this device is marketed to the general public because there is the possibility that it could induce seizures in some people. The literature and the product description provide warnings that people prone to seizures and on psychotropic medications should NOT use it without consulting with their physicians.I'm guessing that the type of people who are looking at this product are probably interested in meditation, self development and our expansion of consciousness. If this is true, you may be interested inIntegral Life Practice Starter Kit. You can read my review about the details, but it provides a structure for engaging yourself in a variety of practices physical, emotional, mental and spiritual all at the same time to bring about transformation. Ken Wilber is a very reputable author and this kit is well thought out.There are many books on biofeedback and neurobiofeedback as well. For the layperson, it is difficult to know what to choose. If you are serious about this type of technology, however, I would recommendAwakening the Mind PA  \n",

Followed their instructions for about 10 days (3 days past their \"break in\" period). I couldn't wait to get them out of my shoes by the end of the day. Foot adjusted somewhat, but not that much. Same with my fiancee. Decided to return them.Sent them back via UPS with deliver confirmation and signature. Walk Fit received them back in mid-September, 2005. No refund given as of yet. No returned emails or phone calls to customer service.Bottom line  \n",

The memory foam is great and contours to my back. However, the massage feature is built into a plastic box within the memory foam. If you apply to much pressure, you feel the platic pressing against your back. I used it about five minutes in the car before I couldn't take it any longer. The batteries and plastic kept pressing into my back. I'm 6 feet tall and about 160 lbs, so I think anyone with a large to medium build would probably agree that the massage feature does more harm than good. As an alternative, I would recommend a lumbar support without the electronic massage feature.  \n",

It also seems sturdy and not squeeky as one review had noted. The quality is not exquisit but that was to be expected. It seems durable enough for what I need it for as far as my massage practice. The upolstery is good but a little loose so the foam which is almost too soft/smushy is out of wack when I get up from the stool, which may pose a problem with extended use. We'll see.  \n",

She has trouble with RA in her neck. She has used the Therabeads cervical and finds it pretty easy to use and helpful. The hard part is that you must take it out of the sleeve each time before micro-waving and then put the sleeve on it again. This is not easy for my mom. It does warm up enough and keep warm for a period of time which does help. I would recommend this product.  \n",

The second and third months it detected ovulation a week late! I had to use an ovulation predictor kit to verify if the OV Watch was working correctly, and it was not. I received a surge from the OPK and the OV Watch didn't detect ovulation until much later. I was very disappointed with this product and the company only has a 30 day return policy. It takes more than 30 days to determine if this product is working for you. I wish I bought the Clear Blue Easy Monitor.  \n",

I was quite excited to get a faint line for the first time after months of ttc. I was quite disappointed when that line couldn't be duplicated on any store brand test. The lines kept coming, even some darker than others but af showed on time. I then tried the test about a week into my next cycle and got the same faint line. These tests are duds and heart breaking. I am very sorry I wasted my money on them.  \n",

They really didnt do a very good job at controlling leaks. They were smaller in dimensions than expected. The crotch width wasnt enough to cover even a very thin disposable diaper. And they didnt ride high enough in either the front or the back to be effective. I would not buy them again. i would probly order a pair of leakmasters.  \n",

One person expressed it clearly stating something to the fact of it has a great demo mode, but no way to combine the rolling and shaitsu any other time. That is my one criticism of the product. The size and weight are fine and the lights are not bright if you use the cover provided. I would suggest unplugging the unit after each use so the lights don't burn out.  \n",

The only problem is that Thomas falls off the track too much when trying to go around the curves and where there is a break in the tracks (such as a switch track). My husband and I believe this is due to the fact that the wheels have rubber on them. It probably was not neccessary to put rubber on all of the wheels, especially the front ones. In looking at the Brio battery operated set, the engine only has rubber on the middle wheels - this is probably a better system. Also, Battery operated Thomas is higher than all of the other trains and cars, so the magnets don't hook on as well as they would with the regular engines.

Although it is alot of fun, extreme caution should be adhered to because of the spinning blades. I am disappointed however, because the blades no longer spin due to some problem.  \n",

I haven't yet received my item - but I can allready leave my comment - how fun is it Five stars of course - I think I love Little People as much or more than my 2 1/2 year old son! Educational value - what better way to teach toddlers the true meaning of Christmas than with cute little characters they can relate to! Durabilaty - I guarntee if I had purchased this a year ago when my son chewed on everything insight these would have made quite the teeter :) they're tough little plastice pieces - what more can I say! I'll be ordering many more for nieces - nephews - and friends children!  \n",

The Minimates are similar to legos, so it is really hard to break them. Kirk breaks down into 14 pieces. YOu can also interchange them with other Minimates for unlimited fun. Kirks phaser is awesome. Minimates are very easy to pose. I have them at the office and my buddy likes to have the Gorn attacking Kirk and Kirk shooting at him.  \n",

Everyone loves it. My neice and two of my friends want to order it. It's safe under the tree for babies.

              "170  The set is really cute, and Thomas really chugs along. My daughter really enjoys watching Thomas go. The only problem is that Thomas falls off the track too much when trying to go around the curves and where there is a break in the tracks (such as a switch track). My husband and I believe this is due to the fact that the wheels have rubber on them. It probably was not neccessary to put rubber on all of the wheels, especially the front ones. In looking at the Brio battery operated set, the engine only has rubber on the middle wheels - this is probably a better system. Also, Battery operated Thomas is higher than all of the other trains and cars, so the magnets don't hook on as well as they would with the regular engines. But those things aside, it really is a very fun thing to play with - adults and children!!  \n",

Plus, at 180 calories each, they shave a few calories off of the other bars of this type without sacrificing flavor or size.The texture tends to be granola/krispie crunch with a flavored thin layer of frosting. If you like a more creamy filling, these bars probably aren't for you. If you enjoy crunch and substance though, they're a great alternative to other meal replacement bars.My favorites are S'Mores and Lemon Zest flavors. I do like that Luna puts out some flavors besides pure chocolate bar or chocolate peanut butter.

Amazing that a protein bar can taste this good and still be half way decent for you.  \n",

However, I do not recommend buying it through the mail, as the last two times I have done so, the bars have arrived in an unsatisfactory state. Both times, it was obvious that this food product was exposed to enough heat to get the bars to melt to the point that they are miscolored and misshapen. I don't know whether the shipment of food like this could be done better, but I will be returning to the good old grocery store for these.  \n",

Very easy to eat on the go. I have one on race morning with about 12 ozs of milk. I try to finish it about 45 mins to an hour before the race. With about 15 mins to go I'll have 10-15 ozs of sports drink. I don't drink anything during the race. This has worked flawlessly for anything up to 10k.  \n",
              "2743                                     After my son got a diagnosis on the Autism spectrum, I started doing research on diet. Our diet has changed dramatically; we are all dairy, wheat and refined sugar free, but the one thing my son missed was the cereal bar. I used to give him TONS of the Nutri-Grain bars until I read what was in them. (Just try to find one without HFCS!) These are the perfect substitute. Not only do they taste great, but they travel well. I toss one in his backpack for pre-school snack time and it holds him for hours. I paid $7 for a box of 6 in the store then came here to find them on SALE??!! I just ordered four boxes and will be ordering more. We've tried the choco peanut flavor and it's a toddler favorite. I'm a fan of the superfood. They also don't look over processed or \"manicured\". They look like something I would make, but in attractive packaging so my son thinks he's getting a treat. Love them, love them, love them!  \n",

They come in a variety of flavors. Plus, at 180 calories each, they shave a few calories off of the other bars of this type without sacrificing flavor or size.The texture tends to be granola/krispie crunch with a flavored thin layer of frosting. If you like a more creamy filling, these bars probably aren't for you. If you enjoy crunch and substance though, they're a great alternative to other meal replacement bars.My favorites are S'Mores and Lemon Zest flavors. I do like that Luna puts out some flavors besides pure chocolate bar or chocolate peanut butter. I've replaced my previous morning SlimFast Optima bar with a Luna bar, and the variety of delicious flavors keeps me much more satisfied than the SF bars did.  \n",

The microwave method simply doesn't work - you end up with a layer of hardened oats and exploding liquid on top. What is best to do is to use a pan. Boil the water as the package directs (though unless you want it salty, I'd use only a dash of salt as opposed to 1/2 tsp.). When you add the porridge, add it into the simmering water bit by bit, whisking throughly during and after. Then simmer as normal with the lid on. This method solved all my problems with the porridge. It made it fluffy, light and truly edible. No more scraping burnt porridge off the bottom of the pan or rushing to break up gluey lumps. Now, I make a batch of this and simply heat it up with a little milk and cinnamon every morning.</td>\n",

FANTASTIC!!!! We love them, and that's even after we're on our second set of 12 boxes. The strawberry flavoring tastes real, not fake like regular pop tarts. Overall, the taste is sweet but not overly so. This flavor is better than the apple cinnamon, which we have also tried. Definitely one of our best Amazon purchases ever.  \n",

But 12 boxes is probably about 10 too many. I won't complain since I spent less than a dollar a box, but I would certainly never pay full price for them. They are organic, which is nice, but they don't taste anything like pop-tarts, so I unfortunately have a little trouble getting my toddler to eat them. Unless you know you REALLY love this variety or you plan to share it with another family or two, I wouldn't recommend a case this big. Over all though, the product isn't bad, but it's by no means fantastic.  \n",
              "4577  This is delicious, classic Scottish-style porridge, but it took me a few tries to get it right. The microwave method simply doesn't work - you end up with a layer of hardened oats and exploding liquid on top. What is best to do is to use a pan. Boil the water as the package directs (though unless you want it salty, I'd use only a dash of salt as opposed to 1/2 tsp.). When you add the porridge, add it into the simmering water bit by bit, whisking throughly during and after. Then simmer as normal with the lid on. This method solved all my problems with the porridge. It made it fluffy, light and truly edible. No more scraping burnt porridge off the bottom of the pan or rushing to break up gluey lumps. Now, I make a batch of this and simply heat it up with a little milk and cinnamon every morning.  \n",

We aren't supposed to have more than 15 grams of sugar for a whole day, and this had 22 grams per cookie! Ugh! Pureed prune, evaporated cane juice, and more, made it very Unhealthy. Healthy would be stevia (which also lowers your blood pressure) and xylitol as they have a \"zero\" count for sugar but taste sweet. Sucralose is Splenda and is really bad for your body as it contains chlorine, and can damage your organs and reproductive functions. If stevia or xylitol was used, you'd definitely have another customer. :)  \n",

I like the moistness of the recipe, and that they are not overly sweet. We get no glycemic rush from these because they contain only whole and natural foods. I think they are a perfect meal replacement, trail snack or appetite-surpressing treat to have before meals. The flavor is superior to the flater taste of the Raw Revolution chocolate flavor without coconut.  \n",

I like the texture of the cashew. It's not as hard as the almond, which tends to get stuck in my teeth. I love the flavor, cashewy, sweet, and a little salty. Super tasty! I also like to portion size. It's just right. The packaging is easy to open, which I particularly value. The pouches fit easily in my purse for a great snack at work. I highly recommend this product.  \n",

I made it according to the directions and served it to people at Thanksgiving and not a single person liked it. I threw the whole thing away. It has nice texture and is attractive but the taste of this mix is just wrong.  \n",

              "1839  I just ordered a case of this mix and a Muffin Magic appliance from Amazon. I had them delivered to my job since I'm not home during the day to accept deliveries. In just a few minutes I had the Muffin Magic plugged in and the Whole Wheat Wild Blueberry muffin mix prepared. This box, which says it makes 8 muffins, made 6 muffins in the appliance.Everyone loved them. They're not overly sweet, but sweet enough so they can be eaten plain. They would probably be excellent toasted with maybe a little butter and/or jam, but they didn't last long enough to find out. Everyone ate them warm, right out of the Muffin magic machine.  \n",

              "4316                I've been dying to have pizza again since I recently went gluten free, so I picked this up at a local store to give it a shot.Wow, was it amazing!! This mix made the heaviest deep dish pizza I've ever seen! I haven't even been able to make a pizza crust like this with regular flour. We loaded the dough with cheese, sauce, and pepperoni, and we're still trying to finish the pizza, days later. It doesn't take exactly like \"regular\" pizza crust, but I almost can't remember the taste of \"regular\" pizza crust after eating this, it was so good!Thank you, Gluten-Free Pantry, for giving us such a great pizza crust!  \n",
