"Hi! I'm Martine Redman and I created this puzzle for Briarpatch using a great photo from Jean Marzollo and Walter Wick's terrific book, I Spy School Days. Kids need lots of practice to master the ABC's, and this puzzle provides an enjoyable reinforcing tool. Its visual richness helps non-readers and readers alike to remember word associations, and the wealth of cleverly chosen objects surrounding each letter promote language development. The riddle included multiplies the fun of assembling this colorful puzzle. For another great Briarpatch puzzle, check out I Spy Blocks. END",puzzles

"You can give a MagnaDoodle to any kid who's able to grasp the stylus; just babyproof it by cutting off the string that attaches the stylus to the board, and taking away the smaller accessories until the kid is old enough not to choke. Kid can then scribble to his or her heart's content without making any mess ever, and practicing a lot is how they get ready for pencils and crayons and paint etc. It's also perfect for teaching letters and numbers and shapes since you draw them each time, which is more interesting to little kids than other teaching toys. Our MagnaDoodles have tended to die of being stepped on, which warps the board and makes the erase lever difficult to slide, so keep it off the floor if you want to make it last.",arts crafts
"Mitchum Clear Gel Anti-Perspirant is an effective deodorant. The """"perk"""" to this product is that it does not stain or mark up your clothes, as do many deodorants and anti-perspirants. I noticed marked improvement in effectiveness. My underarms remained absolutely dry -- not an experience I've had with similar products. I would definitely recommend this because of its price and effectiveness/efficiency.",personal care
"I loved the flavor of the bars!!! I really didn't expect them to be as good as they are!!! I have had other nutritional bars that tasted really nasty. I'd buy the Balance Bars again, and plan on doing so. Even my children liked them! The bars gave me energy when I ate them in the late afternoon. They were a real pick-me-up! I'd recommend this product to a friend in a heartbeat. It's nice to know you can buy a nutritional bar that tastes good and seems more like a snack!",nutrition wellness
My 5 year old daughter loved following the life cycle of the butterflies. I am sure she will always remember the summer we had a butterfly house.We received 5 caterpillars at exactly the time requested and all 5 caterpillars survived and became butterflies!It was wonderful to see the pride in my daughter's face when her &quot;babies&quot; were born.What a great &quot;toy&quot;!,learning education

Seriously folks, these little miracles are by far the best way I've found so far to power portable gadgets, and what's even better is that all of the gadgets are designed specifically for use with these &quot;batteries&quot;.

"I CONFESS I AM AN ADDICT!! Recently I recieved Slingo as a gift from my best friend. I had never seen or heard of this game before, but she said that it was the best game on the AOL internet and warned me that it was very addictive. I did not believe it, I thought most electronic games were basically the same. BOY WAS I WRONG!! It took me some time to learn how to play the game correctly. If you have never played Slingo before read the instruction sheet, this is one game you cannot learn just by playing with it. Once I got going it was hard for me to stop, I kept telling myself just one more game, one more! You get points by filling up the spaces on a numerical bingo card; by matching the Numbers, getting Jokers, and if you are lucky Gold Coins. You can also get Free Spins these will help you at the end of the game. Beware, with every spin you take you risk loosing half of your points to a Sneaky Little Devil with a nasty laugh. I know he is not real but sometimes I would like to reach in and strangle him. If you are very lucky and fill up all of the available spaces you get a SLINGO and bonus points. Slingo is both frustrating (the Devil) and exhilarating (getting a Slingo) it also teaches stradegy, just which number do want to pick with a Joker the right pick can make all the difference. The game has several nice features it has automatic shut off, nice sound effects that are not too loud, a mute button if you want to use it, and it keeps track of your 5 highest scores to give you something to shoot for. The only feature that I did not like was the spin numbers and symbols (Joker, Free Spin, Gold Coin, Devil) that appear at the bottom of each row, these are the numbers and symbols that you use to match those on the screen. Unlike the rest of the numbers and symbols on the screen these are not bold and can be a hard to read. BOTTOM LINE THIS IS HANDS DOWN THE BEST ELECTRONIC GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED!!!!",electronics for kids
"If you are one of those people that collects these things, then by all means get it, because it will thrill and amaze you. For you kids, though--basically it'll just sit there, and adults you know will tell you that you shouldn't play with it, because it will be worth something someday. Whatever. Pretty durable if you decide not to listen to them. Not very educational--it doesn't espouse the virtues of peace, other than the cute little peace symbol.",stuffed animals plush
Peace is a beautiful multicolored bear. No two are alike. He is very soft and highly sought after. Both children and adults love this adorable bear.,stuffed animals plush
"I have played checkers for over a year now, and I'm quite serious about the game. I was hoping for this hand held checkers game to fine tune my skills and learn some new moves. The game is very easy to play and very easy to hold. For begining play the game is difficult. Yet for anyone that is serious about the game and has been playing for over six months the computer opponent is very easy to beat, but for kids and people wanted to learn the exciting game of checkers it is a must to have. If they come out with another hand held game that is harder to beat, I will have to buy that one.",electronics for kids

"My kids have alot of fun with this spongy clay. They love mixing up new colors and creating figures that even float in the tub. I like that it doesn't have an odor and doesn't make much of a mess.One bad thing (as it is with most modeling clays)is that little pieces (like attached eyes and noses), after the figures have dried, fall off really easily. Otherwise, the figures are pretty durable.",arts crafts
"I liked the Breath Right Nasal Strips. They kept my nostrils open all night, and I have had no problem with them lasting all night. As a matter of fact, until I started taking them off in the shower, they were still very secure when morning came around. I had a difficult time peeling them off until I got them wet and soapy. I also appreciate the fact that I don't have to take drugs to keep my nose clear at night.",health care
This shaver was much better than others I have tried in the past. It didn't leave me with tiny areas of bleeding. It gives a nice smooth shave. The handle is very easy to grip while in the shower. I'd gladly recommend this product for all females in need of a new shaver.,personal care

"I much prefer the taste. My husband has always used Scope, and I've avoid using it as much as possible. This new Scope is much better, and I definitely prefer it. With regular Scope and some other products I've used, I hate the taste so much that I rinse my mouth out and lose the fresh feeling that the mouthwash gives. With new Scope, I don't have to do that. I would definitely recommend it -- especially to people who are not good at tolerating strong tastes in their mouthwash.",personal care
My husband liked the fresh scent of the Zest bar. He also thought that it cleaned well. I found the bar to be drying to my skin and would prefer a body wash with moisturizers.,personal care

"I'd recommend this product. In fact, I already have. It gives a very cold sensation to let you know it's working! My lips look great and feel fabulous for the day with twice-daily applications. Unfortunately, it doesn't have lasting effects. It must be applied two or three times daily. A longer effect would have been excellent. But despite the inconvenience, this is a wonderful product, far superior to anything else I have tried. I'll continue to use it.",personal care
I enjoy Slingo in the internet and purchased the hand held game for my mom. I was very disappointed with the display of the game. The numbers are very hard to read and by the time you make them out the fun is gone. Since this was my moms first experience with the game she wasn't willling to put up with the dim lighting. I had to give the game away. Can not believe other people do not find this a problem.,electronics for kids
"I liked it very much. It lubricated my face very well and rinsed very clean. It left my face feeling smooth, clean and refreshed. What I didn't like about it was the cap. It would have soap residue inside, even though it was cleaned when put away. Overall, I was very pleased and would buy more.",personal care
"I think that Opti-Free Rewetting Drops is a good product. I have very sensitive eyes and some drops that I've used sting and irritate, but I didn't have any problems with this product in that area. Although I did find that I had to keep using them in order for my eyes to remain lubricated.",personal care
"The moisturizing ability of this product was excellent. I had chapped lips when I received it and it helped right away. I did not like the mentholated ingredient, however, as I found it made my lips perspire. That's an odd way to describe it, but it was most uncomfortable. As the chapping decreased so did this problem.",personal care
"I was pleasantly surprised with the Irish Spring Deodorant Sport Soap. I have very sensitive skin and usually don't use a deodorant bath bar, thinking it will be harsh on my skin. Not so with the Irish Spring. I didn't have any skin irritation problems and I enjoyed the fresh scent. The only thing I would change about this product would be the size of the bar. It's a very large bar and if you have small hands, you might have a difficult time holding onto it in the shower. Other than the size, I would highly recommend this product.",personal care
"The EZ Dose One-Day-At-A-Time Medicine Dispenser is handy for keeping track of days and times to take medication. Each day and time span is clearly marked on each individual lid, and it also has Braille for the sight impaired. Each compartment is deep enough for holding a good amount of pills -- I would say 3-5 average-size pills comfortably. The downside is that it's difficult to snap the lids shut. One must push tightly until it snaps and it could be difficult for someone with weak hands, an impairment, or arthritis. This also holds true for returning the daily pill strip box to the weekly tray. Not as simple a task as perhaps it should be for someone who's ill.",health care
"My four-year-old daughter received the LeapPad for Christmas. The books are easy to follow, and some even have games she can play in addition to reading a story. Using a storybook and pictures, the Pad teaches her how to spell words, create her own sentences, find words that begin or end with the same sound or rhyme and completing the frogs' sentences. The pad and pen are easy to use and hard to lose. The pen is attached with a chord and the book fastens in. She refers to the pad as her own computer and takes it in the car on trips quite often.",electronics for kids

"I get my eyebrows waxed professionally every month. I found that the slanted, stainless steel tips allowed me to easily tweeze my eyebrows so I could maintain the look that I'd gotten from my salon visits. I've tried other tweezers and found these to be far superior, and would recommend them to my friends and family.",personal care
"I'd very much recommend this product. Where most products of this nature are typically very sweet, this one was not overly sugary. It's a pretty good in-between snack and great to take on the go. I took them to work and had them in the late afternoon when I usually have my cravings for sweets from the snack machines.",nutrition wellness
"This is a great product. Unlike other nutritional or supplement bars (i.e., Power Bar), it's not chewy-gooey and bland. It actually has a great taste. It does not make you feel bloated or stuffed, yet does fill you up and aids in energy. I really enjoyed this product and highly recommend it.",nutrition wellness
"I really enjoyed the Balance Bar 40-30-30, Naturally, Yogurt Honey Peanut flavor. They were better than I expected and I will definitely buy them again.

"I was really pleasantly surprised when I tried this product. For all the nutrients it contained I expected it to taste a bit like chocolate-flavored paneling or something comparable. It was actually great. Had a dense, yet rather moist consistency, with a very good flavor. The size is such that it's easy to carry with me on the go and could easily be slipped into a shirt or jacket pocket. I really liked to have one after a workout to give me a very nutritious boost. I imagine if one is looking for a quick, nutrition bar that in NO way skimps on flavor, this one is worth the money. I would definitely recommend this to family and friends.",nutrition wellness
"I would highly recommend these tweezers to anyone. The slanted tip on them prevents accidentally pinched skin (ouch) and also makes it SO easy to pluck out each and every eyebrow hair. I've saved a lot of time since I began using these and since I'm able to get those close hairs as well, I don't have to tweeze as often. If you do decide to purchase these, you won't regret it.",personal care
What a great surprise these bars were! I'm a hiker and have used other brands of energy bars -- most of which do the trick but taste like sawdust. The Balance Bar is moist and tasty with the added bonus of a yogurt coating. I had one for breakfast and it lasted me well into lunch with no hunger cravings. I love that they are nutritionally balanced and I will certainly take them along on my next hiking trip.,nutrition wellness
"The bars were pretty good. Not too chemical-tasting, but a typical sports bar nonetheless. Bland. Texture of cardboard but better than most in consistency. Not sticky like Power Bars. I'd recommend them if you can accept that all sports bars invariably taste like packing material. Good protein content.",nutrition wellness
"I really like Glide Dental Floss. I especially like that the floss doesn't split apart and is strong lasting. I like the way it fits perfectly through the grooves in my mouth, and the way it feels. This product is also nice because it's a simple way to help protect my teeth, and lessen the plaque when I go to the dentist.",personal care
"This is a good snack or break food. After my afternoon workout, it filled me up and gave me energy. It satisfied my craving for a sweet chocolate taste too. It had a good chewy texture and it gave my mouth a good workout, flavor, and chew. It was a bit high on the calorie range, but had all the nutrients to keep it healthy.",nutrition wellness
"My children seemed to really like them. They have a slightly different taste than what I expected. They're almost like a Fig Newton chewy. They were very filling and helped us feel that we were no longer hungry. They helped us feel more energetic. My family tried the product and the children seemed to be the most impressed, although the adults also thought that they felt more """"alive"""".",nutrition wellness

"The Almond Brownie bar was OK. The taste was just as good as any other power-type bar that I've tried. But it wasn't something that I'd crave. I expected it to provide me with more energy, kind of like taking a vitamin. Perhaps not that day, but the next. To be honest, I didn't notice much difference in my level of energy. With the price that they charge for purchasing a power bar, I don't think I'd recommend it to friends and family. I do think that I may purchase them again for myself though.",nutrition wellness

"The Balance chocolate brownie bar with almonds was not the best tasting product out there on the market today. It was heavy and somewhat filling, but very thick, dense, and tasted bland. It really left something to be desired. It was chewy like a brownie and it sort of resembled a brownie, but upon biting into the bar, you just know it's not a brownie. After the first bite, it was kind of hard to eat. It reminded me of these terrible diet cookies that tasted as though they were filled with sawdust. It really needs more taste. Overall, I rated the brownie bar as three stars because I suppose that taste versus nutrition is a tradeoff.",nutrition wellness
"I really liked the flavor of the bars. They were a little sticky however. You need your beverage near by. The ingredients were about the same as other bars, but I felt the flavor was better! I would definitely recommend this product to people who are health minded. I hope the other flavors are as good.",nutrition wellness
"This is a very clever product. I love the idea of the window to see how much floss you have. There's nothing like going to floss, pulling out floss, and having only two inches to floss with! It's thicker than what I'm used to, therefore making it somewhat harder to get in between my teeth, but maybe I'm half-asleep and couldn't floss anyway! Being how it's thicker, there's an advantage ? it's much softer on the gums. After I floss I don't look like I've been in a fighting match with my spouse! I would definitely buy it and recommend it to anyone with sensitive gums!",personal care
I really liked this deodorant. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in purchasing a new brand of deodorant.,personal care
"The Balance Almond Brownie Bar provides a nutritious alternative for when you need a chocolate fix. Unlike other nutritional food bars I've tried, this one pays close attention to providing not only the vitamins you need but also the minerals. Without sacrificing taste, it provides a good balance of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. While it did taste rather good (especially compared to some of the other brands of bars I've tried that resembled flavored cardboard in taste and texture) the Almond Brownie Balance Bar is somewhat dry, though consuming it with a tall, cold glass of milk resolves this issue.",nutrition wellness
"I thought these nutrition bars were quite good. I've tried nutrition bars in the past and have always been disappointed. These bars not only tasted good, but they actually filled me up. I'm a college student and a lot of times I don't have time to stop and eat a full meal between classes. These bars were perfect for an on-the-go burst of energy. I've already recommended them to my fellow roommates and they all enjoyed these bars as well.",nutrition wellness
"The only way I can describe these bars is with the word sweet. Too sweet, in fact. They have a good taste as long as you have a real sweet tooth. They're good on the run, but unless you're used to lots of sugar in the morning, I wouldn't recommend them for breakfast. Maybe in place of dessert though.",nutrition wellness
"I feel this product was very absorbent, and I'd use it again. However, I do like the pads with wings, because my flow is very heavy, and they prevent stains. I'd use these on days my flow is lighter. I'd recommend this product to friends and family, and women who don't have extremely heavy flow.",personal care
"The taste was slightly chalky but altogether pleasing. After all, it's NOT a candy bar! Also, it would be a great idea to place a set of instructions for use in with the product. I ate one bar for breakfast and one for lunch, but I had no idea if that was a reasonable use of the product. Finally, the bars are easy to open and easy to carry in a purse or a backpack. I'll be buying more Balance Bars for my meals of the future!",nutrition wellness
I really like this nutrition bar. I've tried many nutrition bars over the years and I rate this one right in the top two or three. It's very tasty -- much like a cross between a chocolate/raspberry truffle and a 3-Musketeers bar. My kids like them too.,nutrition wellness

These bars are great if you don't have time in the morning to fix a big breakfast -- just eat one of these and you're good to go 'til lunchtime.",nutrition wellness
"The Comfort Bath disposable washcloths were conveniently packaged and easy to use. The reseal feature is very useful. Each cloth was very moist and had a pleasing fragrance. The material was substantial, yet soft. I used them to bathe my sick child. I plan to use them in the future on camping trips, where bathing facilities are not easily accessible.",medical supplies equipment
"When I first tried this product, I thought that it tasted great. It tasted like a fresh breath of mint gum. But the taste soon wore off, and it started to taste like the polish that a dentist uses. I dislike the pasty taste. I guess that I'm more of a gel-type of person. It was a good performing toothpaste, effective in cleaning my teeth. If you're looking for a good toothpaste, I would recommend it, if you prefer a toothpaste to a gel.",personal care
This is an excellent product. Very comfortable and easy to use. I didn't have any discomfort adjusting to using these insoles. They make walking more comfortable.,health care
"What I liked about this product was the fresh taste. This bar was moist and you could really taste the ingredients (peanut butter and chocolate chips.) For me, the bar was very filling just by itself, but for my husband it wasn't as filling. Overall, the bar was of good quality and tasted good. I think that compared to other bars of the same nature, this one would have to be better.",nutrition wellness
"I really liked the taste of the Power Bars. They were by far the best food bars I've ever eaten. They didn't really taste like peanut butter, but the chocolate was good. They were very dense, so it was hard to eat the whole thing. I really enjoyed them a lot!",nutrition wellness
"I thought this Power Bar was great! I'm a fitness nut always looking for ways to improve my level of fitness. This will certainly be added to my shopping list. The chocolate taste was superb, and the bar was quite filling. With only four grams of fat and seven grams of protein, it was a great snack that filled me up. And I do mean filled me up. With a large glass of water, it kept me going for a couple of hours without being hungry. The texture of the bar, if you're not use to sports bars, was heavy, but that's where the """"filling"""" comes in. It lives up to its promise to being a moist and crunchy energy bar! I'd surely recommend it over other ones that I've tasted. The real chocolate really makes the bar!",nutrition wellness
"I was really impressed with this product. Always before I'd used Listerine. However, Scope had a much better taste and wasn't quite so strong. It had a nice tingle but it didn't make my mouth feel like it was burning. It also made my mouth feel a lot cleaner for a lot longer time. If I used it right before bed, I didn't wake up with bad morning breath.",personal care
I really liked this product a lot. They work great for keeping the nose from becoming sore and they're really strong as well. The Cold Care Ultra product is even better than the lotion type. It worked just as well to prevent my nose from getting sore. And you don't have to worry if you used them on the fly to wipe your glasses clean. Definitely switching to these. I give them a high 5 stars.,household supplies
"These didn't really taste the way I expected and I didn't care for them. I like peanut butter and chocolate chips, but I just didn't like them together. My son and husband both loved them, so I guess it's your preference. Maybe I will try a different flavor because I need all the energy I can get.",nutrition wellness

However, after countless hours that flew by as seconds I have the dummy's solution to this mind-boggler. The 4 star fun rating I gave to the infamous Rubik's cube is indeed only if you know how to solve it, otherwise I'd say a 3 better suits it. Still alot of fun, though.",puzzles

However, my husband felt after a day or two of using it, his teeth felt MORE sensitive. Even just breathing in cold air seemed to bother his teeth.",personal care
"The Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Harvest Power Bars are great! My husband and I like to use them during our bike rides. We typically ride between 30-40 miles at a time, and half way through, we like to stop and take a Power Bar break. The Power Bars are great for giving you a little bit of extra energy, plus they help if you're getting a little hungry. They're a nutritious snack and they taste great. The Harvest Bars have the texture of a granola bar. The other bars have a smooth texture, whereas these give you some crunch. It really does taste like Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip. I would definitely recommend this product to someone if they asked for a recommendation for an energy bar. Great stuff!",nutrition wellness

"I choose this product because I help care for my elderly grandmother. This product deserves its name. She suffers with bladder control both day and night. The fit of these is great, especially in the leg area. The absorbency is excellent. She has spent a lot of restless nights having to get up and change, because of leakage and just feeling wet. This was never a problem with the Depends. She just slept through the night. I would recommend this product to everyone. They're rather costly, but you get just what you pay for and that's what really counts.",health care
"Light fresh scent and absorbs well. Protects better than some other similar products I have tried, however, longer style version would help protect underpants better. Scent is also better than other similar products I have tried. Economy pack is economical and the price that drugstore.com offers is very comparable to that of the name brand super stores.",personal care
I tried the product once and threw it away. It tasted like I was drinking alcohol with soap in it. It had a minty aftertaste but the initial taste is pretty nasty. The aftertaste was extremely strong also. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. I'd stick with Scope.,personal care
"I went into this thinking the Rembrandt toothpaste might not taste that great, but I found that it had a pleasing taste. I don't know if after seven days I can judge the whitening aspects of this product (which is the primary reason I would buy it). I felt like my teeth looked better, but not significantly different. I'd buy this product and give it a longer test for sure.",personal care
"I believe it kept me dry similar to other products, but there were two things that I found I disliked. First, the odor of the product was overpowering, even after an hour or two. I don't like the girly smell. Also, after applying the product, it would get on any pullover shirt. Beyond these two dislikes, I believe the product was very good and did what it was supposed to do.",personal care

"This is a four week program, so I'm only half way through it, but so far it seems to be working! It doesn't have a very pleasant taste, and you need to leave it in your mouth for quite a while.... but it leaves your breath fresh and seems to be showing results. So far so good!",personal care
I liked the great taste of this mouthwash. The taste wasn't really medicine-like or strong. The Scope Cool Peppermint Mouthwash left my mouth with a clean taste. I've tried other washes and I prefer the Scope because it didn't burn my mouth like others have.,personal care
"Tom's Natural Deodorant Soap does exactly what it claims to do. It has a very creamy consistency, lathers nicely, doesn't dry out your skin, and works well as a deodorant.

"I like Reach Act Anticavity Fluoride Rinse. The taste is very good. It's not too strong, so I can actually hold it in my mouth for the recommended one minute. With some other mouthwashes that's very hard to do. I really like their measuring system -- it's very convenient. Before, I'd always put mouthwash in the cap. When I screwed it back on, the mouthwash leftovers would drip and make the bottle and sink dirty and sticky. With Reach Act there's no spillage -- plus you get the right amount every time. I'd definitely recommend it to a friend.",personal care

"The test was easy enough to use. However, it was messy, as the urine collection pad didn't have a cover on it. You have to place it on the table with the collection pad facing downwards (since the result window is on the other side) and that resulted in a most unhygienic and messy situation with urine on the table. I found that to be the biggest drawback. Also, reading the results wasn't easy; there's a difference between the darkness of the lines, even if you have two lines that would indicate a positive result.

"I was amazed by the beauty of Lego's X-Wing Fighter. This ship is truly the most faithful adaptation of a Star Wars craft, and is a sight to behold. In terms of realism, it easily surpasses any other spaceship in the Lego collection. The techs at Lego are also to be praised for the ship's functionality. The wings open and close using standard Lego ratchet-hinges, which allows them to lock in either position. The hatch opens easily and gives easy access. R2-D2 is also present and fits snugly in his compartment, right where he should be. There are even two cargo spaces, to store lightsabers, etc.I suppose my judgment is biased by that fact that I think the X-Wing Fighter is the most attractive spacecraft in the entire Star Wars movie series (with the possible exception of Queen Amidala's transport), but I cannot imagine a Lego enthusiast passing this up.

They really get competitive about who can find the clues first AND there are 3 double-sided panels filled with plenty of other items and characters for them to find (If you don't limit yourself to just asking them to find the clues, it can be so much more fun!). There are three sets of clues included on each side of the panels...one set of clues is permanently glued on, but the other two sets are on reversible inserts that do tend to get worn down and misplaced.

The only problem is that Thomas falls off the track too much when trying to go around the curves and where there is a break in the tracks (such as a switch track).

In looking at the Brio battery operated set, the engine only has rubber on the middle wheels - this is probably a better system.

"This shaver is totally worthless. It gives an uneven shave, for one thing; you have to go over the same spots several times to get enough of the hairs evenly trimmed. Also, if you have a thick beard, be prepared to continuously take the plastic guard off after each pass; it doesn't handle a lot of hair well.One other thing to keep in mind if you have a thick beard is to be prepared for the possibility of shaving it over several sessions. the battery in my unit is worthless. It craps out on me after five minutes, despite an all night charge. This is after a total ownership time measured in a few months, and using it only a few times each month.My advice is to pass this one up and go ahead and spend the money on a real shaver, something like a norelco.

I read the reviews of this product and purchased the Alphabet Apple for my toddler based on these. Although I think it is a great educational toy and virtually indistructable it definitely isn't terribly useful or helpful for a 2 year old as you claimed.

My daughter received a blopen kit over a year ago. She has used it for many school projects and also just for fun. She and her friends love it and the teachers have commented on how original her projects are. They want to know how she did it. She did one project which had to do with space and planets. She used the blopens to make the background(Blue black and purple). It looked realistic and then she mounted her planets on top. They were also made using the blopens and the whole effect was very artistic. The only negative comment I have is that I have not been able to find replacement pens anywhere including on the internet.

It works exactly as described - the gold discs massage your skin while removing the hair, virtually eliminating the pain other hair removal systems can cause. (Granted, you will sense the hair being removed. It is, after all, taking it out at the root. But it doesn't hurt.) It removes hair from essentially any area of the body, and you really can use it the day after shaving.I used it on my legs, underarms, bikini area, fingers, toes...heck, I wanted to wake up my little brother and take off all of his hair too! (Luckily for him, I didn't.) Two things - it's a bit noisy, so be prepared for that, but you shouldn't be nervous or associate that with its level of gentleness. And I've found it works best if you use an up and down motion instead of the small circles recommended in the manual.I used to shave every day, which was time-consuming and annoying. I tried waxing, but it was messy and never really got all the hair off -- not to mention living with icky stubble for the hair to grow long enough to re-wax. But no more!

We immediately ran to our lego box and found four grumpy medieval men and replaced their helmets with the caps.

"My daughter and I loved this. For both of us,coloring is always fun. Me, for the mess free it claimed. I was so disappointed. The markers are ""white"" until you color on the Color Wonder paper. After a long time of coloring, the markers pick up the color. In other words, if you are using green, after several strokes, the color gets picked up by the marker tip. And that will get on furniture. The concept is great if they can fix that problem. Generic markers are a lot easier to get out. The pouch was a nice idea but the papers or book falls out because the top and bottom are not enclosed. Here in Arizona, we have the Queen of Clean ...and she has wonderful clean saving tips on getting markers and crayons out of a lot of things. So far though, nothing worked on my dinner table to get the color wonder out. ...If this problem is solved and the mess free really becomes mess free, I will get those again.

"I have chronic back and neck pain and some arthritis. I have used and worn-out a number of massagers over the years. Usually my complaint is that they are too noisy and get hot after a few minutes of use. The HoMedics PA-1 Action Massager is no exception. It's no louder than any of the others, and it gets too hot to use after about 15 minutes. I believe the manufacturer warns of this in the instructions. What I didn't expect was that the darn thing would bite! Yes, the HoMedics PA-1 Action Massager not only bites, it pulls hair. If you get it near your hairline, or near an area that is small, like your earlobes, you will get bitten and pinched. The manufacturer also warns of this, but who reads instructions. The HoMedics PA-1 Action Massager is also heavy (about 4 pounds)and cumbersome. It's potentiometer allows for some variation in the speed of the vibration, but the effects at lower speeds seem to be more powerful (and painful) than the teeth-jarring you get at higher speeds.

"Bought this toy for my infant son &amp; he LOVES it! We take it everywhere &amp; it's like his little lovey. It attaches to almost anything, making for familiarity &amp; interest in any situation.

"Celeste is the BEST!! My son absolutely loves this toy! We take it everywhere that we go. My son is very particular about toys. To this point, he hasn't cared for much of anything that I have bought for him. Then one day I was shopping for something else and picked this up and gave it to him. He immediately held on and put it in his mouth. When I tried to take it away to pay for it, he cried. Right now he is 5 1/2 months old and we have had Celeste for about 6 weeks. My son loves to hold on to the black and white tentacles and put the toys in his mouth. He much prefers the sunshine side to the moon/stars side. The toy is very soft and plush and Jameson loves to just pet it with his hands. He also likes the little handle loop at the top bacause it makes a crinkly noise. I recommend this toy because it is very soft and extremely well-made. It doesn't have that harsh sort of cheap feel that so many other soft baby toys have. The face is very inviting and has so many places and textures for a baby to grab onto. Although I have yet to wash it this way, it looks as if it would easily wash in the washing machine.",stuffed animals plush
I read the reviews before buying this toy to make sure it was a good deal and I have not been disappointed. My daughter is 2 1/2 and she loves playing with it. When she has friends over they love to play with it too.I would recommend this toy to any friends with children.,building toys

"Mage Knight is a collectible miniature figurine game. You play by using strategy and battle using math. It is a very challenging game and I wouldnt reccomend it to children 10 and under. Of course some of the smaller figures are sensitive, so they can break when being held while clicking the base. The best part is buying a booster and having the surprise of getting a rare figure. Some of the unique figures are worth quite alot of money so try and keep them in good condition. There are also tournaments where you battle other people and can win prizes.Overall, Mage Knight is an awesome hobby and is extremely addictive.Hans",action toy figures

We bought this for my 8 year old son and it was a total bust. The various field pieces did not hold together well even when anchored to a large Lego building board.

"My in-laws gave this toy to my son for Christmas when he was 19 months old. I thought he was a little young, but he did enjoy pushing all the buttons and making the frog sing.To my amazement, this toy taught him all the letters of the alphabet well before he turned 2. After just a few months of playing with this toy, he could correctly point to any letter I named (&quot;Where is X&quot;) and correctly name any letter I pointed to (&quot;What is this?&quot;).The song to teach each letter is the same, so to an adult the singing is rather repetitious. But this doesn't seem to bother children. After several months of play, a couple of the letters became hard to push, but that bothered me more than it did my son.I was impressed with how effectively an electronic toy could teach such a young child. I never set out to teach my son the alphabet so early, he learned it all on his own by interacting with this toy.",electronics for kids

Toots is great - can run on the track or just across the floor. Both of my boys have spent alot of time playing with this and it's held up well - even after being disassembled/reassembled twice. Only complaint - Fisher Price if you're listening - is that the train runs on 4 &quot;AA&quot; batteries - with a train of this size, you'd think they could've designed it to run off of &quot;C&quot; batteries or something - stock up on the &quot;AA&quot; cause Toots goes thru fuel fast!

My son got this for a present when he was a little under 2. These were the precursor to his love for all Lego-type toys. He has since gone on to smaller and more complex &quot;blocks&quot; including tinker toys and Lincoln Logs - but he still plays with these whenever his 1 year old brother drags them out of the toy box. They are about as durable as anything comes and they really help hand-eye coordination.,building toys
"This was a nice piece of hardware, but I wonder if it was ever tested on a really dirty floor.The FloorMate went together well, and was easy to use, but don't think that this is a substitute for a dedicated floor scrubber. It was effective at cleaning floors that had little build up or dirt, but wasn't up to the challenge of a dirty, high traffic spot like a kitchen floor.I cleaned a three foot by three foot area of the floor, spending nearly 10 minutes on the test area, with little noticeable improvement. The cleaning agent provided, coupled with the very soft brushes did little at removing stubborn dirt. Hoover's suggestion of using a strong detergent and a stiff brush to remove the dirt made me wonder why I needed the machine in the first place.There is no way to disable the vacuum pickup, so using a stronger, non-recommended cleaner was not possible since the vacuum would bring it into the machine. If the vacuum could be turned off, it could be used as a simble scrubber, but even that is not possible.The scrubbing brushes provided are very soft, with no substitutes available for harder jobs.The FloorMate is a good machine to use if you have already spotless floors and want to maintain them. However, don't expect it to compete with a dedicated floor scrubbing machine.",household supplies
I bought these for my 7 year old nephew for Christmas and he immediately put them on and wanted to shut all of the lights off. He has been using them for almost a year and still uses them. It's rare for a toy to hold his interest that long. They are great for pretend play.,electronics for kids

"I had tinkertoys when I was a kid in the 70's. I wish I knew what happened to that set. In over 15 years of play, I only had two parts break from being stepped on. Now I have a son of my own who requested Tinkertoys for Christmas. I was disappointed right away that everything was much bigger than the 'classic' ones. Of course, doesn't bigger mean better and more durable? Five minutes out of the can, the first rod broke in my 6 year old's hand. I thought he was just being too rough so I tried a few connection tests. Within minutes, I had several more rods cracked and a wooden connector and an end cap split. My son loves building with the ones that haven't broken yet and doesn't want me to take them back, but I don't want to wait for them to split too. I want the good old 'classic' perfect size, durbable toys. Bring them back! I'm going to take this set back and take my chances with the plastic version. If that fails, maybe I'll make my own.

This Center comes with no action figures and the only place it says it is the very bottom of the back of the box (which we noticed as we tossed the box away starting assembly). After almost an hour of putting it together and my son seeing the figures on the picture in the front, he was very disappointed, as were we, that the figures (or atleast one) was not in the box. Being Christmas Day, there isn't a store around that is open, so he will suffer for today. But, he did go and get some of his other figures and they played on the Center most of the day.

And as we have found out, it is VERY difficult to hold the pages in place.When you read the description, it sounds like all you have to do is pop the cartridge into the Mind Station and the pop it into the toy.

It is not exactly accurate to the movie or even the kenner toy, especially in regards to its leg movement and I felt the &quot;head&quot; cockpit was a bit too tall and narrow. However, the more I look at it I really enjoy it and love having it part of my collection. It does come with Chewbacca (a cheaper way to get this mini-fig for those who dont want to spend the money on the Falcon) and the cockpit mult-hinge in the back and top is really nice.

People who have had problems with the rim coming off did not attach it properly and those that tip over did not put sand in the base.

I am still using them and think that I may start seeing improvement in the comfortability of my hands, but it remains up in the air. The looser feeling of the gloves does feel really good and make it easier to type. I would have also preferred that they use some softer or gelly like substance in the palms of the gloves instead of the bean bag type stuff they currently are using. Overall, if your hands hurt before, during, or after typing, these are definately something that you should at least try out for yourself.",medical supplies equipment

When he is a little older ,we will add a swing component. Until then, he will enjoy sliding and climbing and ""staking out the fort with dad"" more than anything else. Assembly was not a problem for us at all. Someone gave me the hint to use dish liqued around the connections so that they slide in easier.",sports outdoor play

"Third Braun foil razor I've owned (5564, 5510 also). I was disappointed with the razor overall. The &quot;floating cutter&quot; works poorly. It seemed like a good idea since it works like my older Braun model, which allows you to push the trimmer up so that it can cut longer hairs before they reach the foil. The problem with this model is that the cutter has a safety guard that effectively keeps my hairs from getting cut. The only way to make it work is to apply a lot of pressure to the razor, which results in getting your skin pinched and cut--ouch! The good news is that you can select &quot;foil&quot; and it becomes a regular foil shaver which works suprisingly well (better than my dual foil model in fact). The pop out trimmer works well on sideburns too.",personal care

I looked all over for this figure. Making WEEKLY trips to [local store] but they were always out. He is my favorite character in the books and the movie so naturally I would do anything to get this figure. When I finally decided I better order him I was afraid that he would not have much detail as the picture shows but when he arrived I was amazed they did such a good detailing job. He looks just like the actor. A great deal of detail was put into his clothes and weapons. I was also amazed that his arrows actually worked because they were alot less bulky than Lurtz's bow and arrows. This is by far my favorite action figure.

"I love how the clone trooper was designed after Jenga Fett, at least helmet wise. Now while I did think that there were some minor faults with the model of the Jenga Fett action figure I bought those faults were nothing compared to the clone troopers. Personally I was let down a bit with the body proportions of the action figure. I found the proportion of the helmet to be slightly bigger and obvious to the human eye. I thought this was strange looking. Flexibility wise, I didn't have problems with that although I wished that I was able to bend the arms at the elbow joints. The body of the figure itself is rather skinny. I thought it would have the similiar mass size of Jenga Fett. What really annoyed me was that the rifle that came with the figure didn't hold well in the hands of the figure. Either the hands or the rifle could have been designed better. I did like the missile launcher. That I didn't have a problem with. Call me picky but this design of the clone trooper could have been better. Nevertheless cool design for a early prototype of the clone trooper before the era of Darth Vader.",action toy figures
"My son has been wanting this playset since he got his first figure and saw the videos. I must say I was as excited to play with it as he was. I was a bit disappointed that the figures don't say more things when hooked up to the back pack. I thought they would say other phrases than what they normally say with their own backpack. It was also sort of a pain to put together. You had to align the tabs just so or it wouldn't pop together. Seems to me, that is a problem with most Fisher Price toys you have to assemble. It always seems like the plastic is cheap and flimsy. Once I assembled this toy though, it did seem sturdy enough.Also,there were about thirty stickers I had to apply myself. My son is three and very happy with the toy and plays with it constantly. We did have to rearrange his room a bit to accommodate it.",action toy figures
"When Lego introduced their first 'Boba Fett's Slave I' I was very disappointed, as must have been many fans of this vehicle. In my opinion it was one of the coolest in the movie, but Lego really botched this one up, except for the Boba Fett figure itself, and Han Solo of course. Luckily, Lego must also have realized their mistake, and have made good use of Slave I's appearance in the new Star Wars movie to make a bigger, badder, and much better Slave I!It improves on all fronts, being much bigger than the original and really looking to scale. The (new) colors are fantastic, and really do look like the movie version. More importantly, the shape resembles the Slave I about as exactly as you can get with Lego!

"This was a cool vehicle in the movie, and a cool toy upon first glance. The detail and coloring are above average, and I like the detail and controls inside the cockpit, though I don't know how I'll get Zam in there and posed correctly because it's cramped. The real thing that troubles me is the ""blow-apart crash action"". Basically you crash the front of the ship into something solid, two panels pop off, and the front end crumples just like a real crash. Neat effect, but it is accomplished through the use of a rubber front end. The two large protrusions on the front of the ship are made out of rubber. This makes them look wavy and out of place compared to the rest of the plastic ship. Is it too much to ask for a simple scale-relica with no gimmicks? For kids this seems to be a great toy and a lot of fun, but for older people seeking more realism it leaves something to be desired. Still, I have to commend Hasbro for coming up with such a unique and well-working mechanism for the crash action. I just wish it didn't look so bad.",action toy figures

It's poseable at the neck,shoulders,elbows,wrists,fingers,(Yeah,Fingers!)waist,hips,knees and ankles.Too bad it's poseability doesn't make up for it's cheap rubber mask. If you're a collector, leave it in the box. But if you're thinking of playing with it (like I know everyone wants to) apply some clear household adhesive to the seam (or wherever it ripped).That should hold it.Once the mask has been touched up, the actual toy is pretty durable, so I gave it a three. But that cheesy mask kind of took away from the fun, so I gave it a four. I don't know educational a doll can get, but it's massive poseability and removable mask do inspire lot's of creativity, so I gave It another four.Overall I'd give this toy a 4 1/2. You should give it a try, too",action toy figures
"I am writing this review to praise the My First Leap Pad product. The ""book"" was given to my son for a Christmas gift last year when he was barely 2. Right away my son figured out how to use the pen and how to press the ""go"" button to start each new activity. It is 8 mos later and this product is still a big hit. My son uses it everyday. He already knows all his ABC's, colors, shapes and we are currently working on phonics. It is wonderful to see his little face light up when he realizes that he has gotten an answer correct. I love this product soo much that I am currently looking for all the new books available. I just can't wait until my child is ready for the next Leap Pad level. This is a product well worth investing in. Like I said my son has used this book EVERYDAY for the past 8 mos, and it has been dropped and tugged on, but is still working fine. One time my son accidently spilled his water on the book and after wiping up the excess water and letting it air dry it was as good as new. Not even a single water stain is visable! My son has also gotten a little curious and tried ripping the books in half, with no success. The books for the My first Leap Pad are just as durable as the holder!! Plus, I have only changed the batteries ONCE in 8mos!! I love this product and plan on buying several to give as gifts!! Leap Frog has out done themselves with this learning tool! Oh, and one more thing, as for the books falling off the main holder, all I can say is that again, my son has used his My First Leap Pad everyday now for the past 8 mos and not once have I seen him struggle to keep the book on the holder. Nor have I had problems with the book falling off, even in the car.This is a GREAT product for parents wanting to get their toddlers off to a head start!!",action toy figures
"This Mini-con 3-pack is really cool. It comes with High Wire, a BMX Bike, Grindor, a motorized skateboard, and Sureshock, a bright orange scooter. The three are really easy to transform, but, because of the simplicity, the educational value is low. However, in addition to being able to connect with larger Armada figures, they can combine with one another to form a five inch- high robot called Perceptor. He also is really easy to assemble. Of all the Mini-cons, I would highly recommend these three.",action toy figures

She also has the ability to combine with Lewa and Kopaka to form a giant warrior toa. This really is a must-have for Bionicle collectors.",building toys

"If you are a fan of Transformers, and Optimus Prime in specific, this is a great toy, with some surprising features. The semi trailer is motorized and changes automatically to a base when the cab is changed to robot, and to legs when the cab is transformed into the top half of the giant super robot mode. The Optimus cab is great, the trailer base is fun, and the tiny car mini-con Sparkplug is very nice too. The super robot formed by combining cab and trailer is the weakest form, but even that looks tall and impressive. This toy is not as complex as ones from Beast Machines or Robots in Disguise, but that makes it more durable and less frustrating for the kids who play hard with their toys. This is my favorite Optimus Prime toy for at least seven years!",action toy figures
"Ok, let see, I opened my Optimus Prime and looked for positives and negatives right away.The POSITIVES- This Optimus prime is huge! He comes in the biggest box we have seen in a while and has a great look as a semi truck. The first transform into the regular robot and battle station is cool. The figure is the first to feature a moving mouth plate even though on this incarnation of Transformers cartoon he dosent move it. The figure is very close to the same idea of the original optimus prime and the smoke stacks becoming a gun is a innovative idea. The base transforming on its own is fun to watch and its very functional with a great deal of room for lots of Mini-cons. The sound effects are interesting and his Mini-con Sparkplug is the coolest so far.The NEGATIVES-The main problem with the figure in regular robot mode is that it looks like hasbro was trying to save money, because there is a lack of joints in his legs. The actual posablity is non-existant. Plus Optimus dosent stand well in his own transforming base.Then we have the Super robot mode. Oh boy, what were they thinking with this. The super mode dosent stand well. If the figure is on a counter top with smooth surface, he tends to start to fall from his weight. The cab that triggers the auto transform of his base, dosent fit easily onto the newly transformed legs in fact if played with in a regular fashion. It can fall apart, and possibly hitting the ground making it dangerous for children.The arms on super mode dont go much past his mid section which makes the fact that he has a gun pointless since if it were real he would shoot his feet. The face of the super robot mode on Optimus Prime looks nothing like Optimus, and is down right ugly. Even though its the only poseable thing on the super mode, which in fact isnt super at all.Lastly, its very hard to get the thing back to vehicle mode after you acheive super robot because the signal from the cab dosent seem to give the right signal when you want it to.The prior Optimus Prime from Transformers:Robots in Disguise is superior to this one in both modes and is more fun to play with. Plus you can pose all the modes on that, even when merged with Ultra Magnus. Back to the drawing board guys, Optimus Prime is supposed to be the best of them all. Make him that way!",action toy figures

No hoop problems (make sure it snaps into place) and it is so sturdy! NO TIPPING PROBLEMS IF YOU FILL THE BASE AS INSTURCTED!!!

"Just in time for Halloween! When I grew up I had a whole army of Masters of the Universe. I watched the cartoon every afternoon. I loved it. Skeletor was always my favorite. But now they have come out with a new cartoon and toy line. I have seen the cartoon and saw the toys in the store. Some people say you can't beat the original, most times it's true, but this is one big exception. I love the show, is much more well written than the original, and Skeletor is finally truely evil and fearful. This toy is definately another improvement. Just look at Skeletor's skull face. It's creepy. And the detail on him is excellent. His head and body are sized right. One problem with the originals is they used the same mold for almost every MOTU character. They just put a diffrent head and armor on, and the head was always too big and the armor cheap looking. Skeletor's clothing is very detailed , it looks like real leather. His feet are bare and you can see the skin pattern all over his body.The original Havoc Staff was a molded plastic purple stick with a ram's head on. It kind of looked like a skull. But on the new one it's so real looking you can see the teeth and bones under the ram skull. The skull and horns are diffrent colors along with the staff itself. His sword is similar to the ones the original Skeletor and He-Man came with. It breaks in two also, but now Skeletor has both, He-Man has an all new Power Sword. The detail on them are great, too. This is my only complaint. The sword doesn't stay together easily, but I'm not too worried about it, I bought him to display not to play with. If you do decide to get Skeletor I recommend getting Panthor also. The two compliment each other. You won't be disappointed.",action toy figures

"I've owned one for 3 months and I have a love hate relationship with it. I like having box cleaned automatically, but it ends up being more work than it''s worth:-Litter gets everywhere because there is no cover that forms a tight seal (like other hooded boxes do). It also gets stuck in all of the cracks and grooves in the box.-Some of our cats dig holes before they go and the littermaid doesn't allow for much litter so they end up going on the plastic. When they scratch afterwards the ltter ends up sticking to the bottom of the box which the rake doesn't get. I end up having to scoop it everyday manually anyway.I'm hoping somebody else has come up with a better design, because I would be willing to pay more for a better box.",cats
"This is it, the highly anticipated 25th Anniversary R2-D2. The companion piece to the Silver Darth Vader. This will be one of the most sought after action figures of the season! Fortunately, rumor has it, that Hasbro has upped the production run of this item by nearly five times!Here's the scoop. This nicely detailed version of R2 really works well. Out of the package he could mingle with the other droids in dioramas, and fit right in. Personally, I think he looks like something that you'd see in an Imperial installation, or maybe the Cloners of Kamino (okay, a princess or two may have a silver droid as well. &lt;G>). Standard articulation, and of course, he's very, very shiny, with cool blue highlights. R2 comes on the same card type that the much coveted 25th Anniversary Darth Vader had, and looks very nice displayed with it. You won't be disappointed.I do hope this is the last of these hard to get figures though. What more can we expect? A Bronze Boba Fett? A Platinum Stormtrooper? A Jade Yoda?

"This is a cute little set and is the only one to include Darth Tyrannus(Count Dooku)and Jedi master Yoda. I bought this a few days ago in my local toy shop for euro13.99!! I think its only worth about seven. The main reason I got the set was for Yoda. He is a much needed one-of-a-kind figure. And the Best thing about Yoda is thet you can not only use him for Episode 2 lego, you can use him for the classics aswell.Darth Tyrannus comes with his red Sith lightsabre with the curved hilt as it was in the movie. Yoda`s lightsabre is bigger than it is in the picture on the Amazon page. In fact it is taller than Yoda himself, but this fact does not really bother me.Tyrannus`s speeder bike has pieces from the castle series on the back which I found very odd. It is a well put together piece though but it is difficult to get Tyrannus into the seat while he holds his lightsabre.It also comes with piece of machinery that is probably supposed to be one of the things that Tyrannus tried to hurl at Yoda.This set overall is very good and is a collector`s item I wouldsay(mainly because of Yoda).",building toys

I was told I could BUY a replacement pen from them so I ordered 5 pens at once so we could keep her happy with this toy. Leap Frog failed to send us even one replacement pen. So here we are, with two units, and no pen. It's such a shame that a more sturdy pen cannot be designed for kids like mine. I also think the pages in the books are way too flimsy.

"I first purchased this toy because it was colorful and cute but mostly because it was on sale for half-price. I took it to a child's first birthday party, where the child had a mountain of gifts, but kept grabbing the Noodle Bug. He tried to play with it in the package but the parents kept trying to show him all the other toys. He refused the other things and carried the Noodle Bug around, still in the box. (His mom told me it is his favorite toy.) Two months ago, my grandson's first birthday came along, so based on the previous experience, I bought a Noodle Bug for him. Sure enough, he immediately began to play with it, and got angry when his daddy took the toy away just long enough to get it out of the box. Whenever I phone my daughter, I hear my grandson in the background playing with the Noodle Bug, and pulling it behind him while he walks around the house. My daughter said he loves all the activities and doesn't become frustrated with missing parts since they are connected to the toy.

Eager to try the unit out, I discovered that the electrical cord had pulled out of the plug that attaches to the base unit. We're lucky we didn't start a fire. I soldered the loose wire back onto the plug and made ready for another attempt. In great anticipation, the cotten candy maker did make cotten candy ... about 4-5 strands. What a disappointment.

"We've got 6 cats, and bought one of these Littermaid boxes about two years ago. With this many cats, it doesn't take long for the box to jam up, and require manual scraping. It seems as if two cats use it in a row, before it has a chance to scrape after the first cat, you have a guaranteed jam.The box is very sensitive to the amount of litter you put in - just a touch too much and it won't be able to complete the sweep, and will keep trying over and over, annoying you to no end. Not enough litter and you have a hard mess to scrape off the plastic bottom.Maybe they should be lining these with some kind of teflon like a frying-pan has! We always keep a 4&quot; scraper next to the box and need to use it daily. What fun to clean out the &quot;teeth&quot; of the litter comb when the cat potties on them.The first box we had lasted just over a year before it's motor died.We replaced that one, reluctantly, with another by Littermaid, and now after about 7 months, somehow it managed to grab the wire in the &quot;teeth&quot; that provides power to the moving comb and when it got to the end to dump, it snapped the wire in half and stopped. For Good...I can fix darn-near anything, so I disassembled it with intentions of rewiring this part, but it seems they are using some special &quot;extra flexible&quot; wire that cannot be found at Home Depot or Radio Shack. They have this cheezy way of providing a retracting action of the wire with some spring steel and some plastic wheels.Anyway, now I have a second &quot;dead&quot; littermaid unit, and will likely have to buy yet a third one, since nobody else makes an automatic litterbox.

"Granted, I am no wimp when it comes to waxing and plucking. I just hate the process of waxing and then plucking to get rid of the strays that waxing missed. I also hate it when you inadvertently get wax stuck to a patch of hair that isn't meant to come out. Having said all that, this epilator works very well. It doesn't hurt any more than waxing (I think much less) and it's a very quick process. The only complaint I have is that it occasionally misses a hair or two, no matter what angle you go at it. But there's no cleanup (except for the quick brushing of the tweezer part) and it all stores away in a cute little pouch.

"As with the previous reviewer, I also received the bath spa for Christmas and finally pulled it out from under the tree for a test run. It's amazing how cold that room-temperature air feels coming out of that mat! It felt like I was sitting on a huge refrigerated gel pak or something.If that wasn't uncomfortable enough, the bath became less of a spa and more of a frightening cauldron! I've got one of those extra large triangle-shaped soaking tubs, so it looks just like the spa tubs except without the bubbles. However, all the other spa baths I've seen and used do not splash the water so far out of the tub that it hits the walls - this Conair mat did! I was afraid at first I had it on the &quot;high&quot; setting, but it was &quot;low&quot; that caused such a stir. The higher setting was, of course, no better. Not that I want to admit this, but I am not a small woman, so I would think that someone normally sized would get thrown around even more and shudder to think of it.I think I might have been able to get past the cold, but I can't relax while fearing that the water will splash out of the tub and onto the floor, cabinets, walls, etc, so the longest I could use the mat was for less than five minutes a couple of times. I'm hoping we can yet exchange it for another model.",health care

It's big for him, on the verge of being too big to carry, but that seems to be ok for him. You should also have a large bathtub if you want to sail it in the bath because of it's size. Be aware that the goblets can get stuck in your drain so make certain you get them all out before you pull the plug, or you'll be getting a shop vac to pull the pieces out of the drain trap.My children love combining all the pieces of different sets so not only does Barbie go sailing with the pirates, but so do farm tractors and a Pride of Lions.

My daughter recieved Baby Tad when she was 11 months old. She absolutely loves him. Baby Tad plays songs and tells colors in the daytime. Then at night you can play music for up to 6 minutes. This is a good learning toy for baby. Baby Tad has went everywhere with us from a car ride to a plane ride. He tells the child that he loves them. My daughter loves to give hugs and kisses to Baby Tad. I would recommend it anyone with a toddler. It truly is a life saver at times when your child will get fussy. We love our Baby Tad!,electronics for kids
"This toy is ARMED TO THE TEETH! He's got weapons galore! The trailer can separate from the cab section to become a multi-functional base! It's equipped with a disc launcher, a missile launcher, a tower gun that's detachable (you can insert it in Scourge's hand!), and a rocket launcher that fires air pressure rockets! This baby comes with a total of 18 accessories (5 discs, 10 MISSILES, 2 rockets, & 1 tower gun)Scourge's robot mode is so cool. He's about the size of Optimus Prime. Scourge comes with his Sword of Fury &'s equipped with shoulder cannons! The color scheme is perfect as are the details!If your Predacon and Decepticon forces need more firepower or troops to defeat Optimus and the Autobots!, then you MUST get Scourge!",action toy figures
"I do not nurse, but like the 5 in 1 idea so I got this. I found my baby laid on his back fine without wiggling off, and loved the toys overhead. He hated laying down unless he was sleeping so the little bit of elevation was great. When he started to get more active and needed tummy time, I found this invaluable! Most abbies hate being on thier bellies because it is hard to hold themselves up. This helped my son so that he didn't feel gravity pulling him down. It allowed him to have around 15 minutes of tummy time aday earlier than he would have tolerated it otherwise. Now he is learning to sit up and the boppy cradles him perfectly for that extra balance and support he needs! I highly recommend this!",action toy figures

He would play with it constantly, and never got tired of it.Well, our son is now 16 months old, and this is STILL one of his favorite toys. He really enjoys running the little train track on top of the table - he especially loves stacking the little blocks that come with this table on the track, then watching them all go around! And because the train track is wind-up, not battery operated, it never runs out of power. (Our son is even beginning to learn how to wind up the track himself!)I can tell our son will get many more months of joy out of this toy. He is just beginning to explore making block towers with the lego blocks that come with it, and lately has had a lot of fun stowing all sorts of toys in the area unerneath the table. Also, the little train has become one of his favorite toys - he runs it all over the house on the floor!Finally, because this toy is easy to disassemble and assemble, and is very sturdy, our son has also found a new game",action toy figures

"After using Norelco and Remington electric shavers for several years, and not being satisfied with the shave, I broke down and bought the Braun last year along with the Self Cleaning accessory. I can finally say that I get a good, close, comfortable shave for the first time in years. It works very well, and the charge lasts approximately 7-8 days. The only complaint is with the self cleaning accessory, and thats minor. Its supposed to start blinking when the cleaning fluid gets low, and turn off completely after 4-5 days to make you change the cartridge. Mine worked well the first couple of months, but now it blinks forever and never turns off. So, when it starts blinking I simply replace the cartridge immediately.",personal care

"In an attempt to make Optimus Prime more affordable, Hasbro releases a smaller, more articulated Optimus Prime that out does his previous incarnation by leaps and bounds. This new version of Prime is a bit smaller than the cab that comes with the more expensive version released earlier this year. Don't let the size worry you though. This toy is a lot nicer than the original.Over-Run is a gray jet with a neat little feature; retractable front landing gear. He also folds up to form Prime's handgun and can be placed on the rear of the truck to give Prime some firepower in vehicle mode.Now, if you already own The larger Optimus Prime toy, you will be able to transform this one no sweat. And, like the other toy, this one suffers from smokestacks-don't want-to stay attached-syndrome. Over-Run simply folds out the arms and flips down the nose of the jet. The wings can be positioned back, front or out to the sides.The best part about robot mode is that he doesn't look as though his head is coming out of his chest like the larger version does. Prime features full neck, shoulder and elbow articulation, waist, hips, and knee joints as well, making him the best-articulated figure in the Armada line to date. Attach a Mini-Con to the post on his back and move it up and down to activate his ""punching"" action. Really, all it is are his shoulders moving back and forth. Not bad and at least it doesn't get in the way of the toy. As stated earlier, Over-Run can transform into his handgun. He can also be stored on the Mini-Con port on Prime's... rear.Overall, if you buy just one Transformers Armada toy, make it Supercon Optimus Prime. You won't be disappointed.

When my parents installed it, the picture came up in black and white. The box shows it in colour. My sister was disapointed, but she just wanted to play the game. I chose the first difficulty level just in case the others were too hard. The game itself is very boring. There are four coloured flowers on the mat, all you have to do is stand on them. Sophie (my sister) tried the first three levels and beat them all easily. But the fourth level was so fast that she could hardly keep up with the lights. She cried, 'Abby, you try!' .

The magnets are quite strong considering their actual size, and their size is much smaller than I'd anticipated from the picture on the box. Each rod is about one inch (2.5 cm)long and maybe 1/4"" wide. That is the only draw back in my opinion because my children are still in the lower end of the age bracket, and so I have to watch that none of the pieces disappear. But I would still recommend this product, especially for an older child who is responsible. It's great to play with it with your children, but due to the size of the pieces, if you have younger ones, you'll just have to watch carefully so that none of the pieces get lost.",learning education

And because the (sold seperately) books and cartridges advance in levels and age groups, this is an item that grows with your kids. Durable? You bet- my oldest son has dropped his Leap Pad on our tile floors more than once, and it hasn't hurt it a bit. We recently took the Leap Pad with us on a long car trip (over 1,500 miles- Oy!). Since we don't have one of those fabulous minivan's w/ DVD player, we thought the Leap Pad would occupy them for a bit. What a pleasant surprise to find it entertained them the majority of the way. Has volume controls (located on the pages of the books)and a ""repeat"" place to hear the last command you might have missed. The ""magic pen"" is wonderful- gives kids the option of having the page read to them, or, touch on an individual word, and it reads only the word for them. HINT",electronics for kids

"He's big, he's impressive, and he's got some interesting gimmicks. I like him best for his vehicle mode and his super robot mode. But transforming the cab alone into the smaller Optimus reveals that this toy isn't exactly well made. Almost every time I transform him, something falls off and needs to be snapped back on. The big gimmick is the electronics which automatically transform the trailer into its battle platform and armor modes.

"I received my reconditioned Braun syncho 7505 two days ago. Someone in my office brought me the package and it was something vibrating inside, I found out that a rubber band was wrapped around the lock button and the unit was on! I was wondering if it vibrated all the way from it's shipping point. The unit definitely was not in near brand new condition as some of the reviewers said. The printing on the back has faded and some blemishes on the rubber bottom near the charging connector. However Braun did provide a new blade and foil. I like the Syncho 7505 because of it's NiMh rechargable battery, which has no recharge memory like the NiCd battery that most other shavers have. I cleaned the whole unit out with alcohol and tried it out. Shaving with it the first time, I accidently scrapped the skin of my adams apple because of this unit is much bulkier than my old Braun Intergral 5414. It did give a closer shave than the 5414 which the battery is dying and can only hold a charge for about 4 shaves. Anyway, I'm keeping this shaver because of it's bargain price.",personal care

"I am rather impressed with this toy. I have purchased a number of other ""toy props"" in the past. I have a few phasers, a Klingon knife, a tricorder, and a couple of communicators, but this phaser/communicator combo from Art Asylum is really very nice. The sculpting is adequate on both items, but what makes these special is the use of light. The communicator is a simple device with a sound chip, but the lighted screen is a nice touch. The classic communicator with the recorder in it was nicely done, and is better than this communicator by far, but still, this is a nice rendition. The phaser has a light at the end when you pull the trigger, as expected, but it was a pleasant surprise to plug in the toy power cell and have it light up! That was really nice. I don't like the orange tip on the gun, but that can't be helped. I'm going to paint mine.

"Zero stars isn't an option so I had to give it one star and even that is totally undeserved. My husband thought this was a good idea when we got our 3rd cat. First, the entire unit with the tent attached was too large to fit in the corner where our old litterbox was kept. So we had to place it in our laundry room. The box itself was too small for my 15 & 12 pound cats to use comfortably use. The first few fork passes were great, but when the box became dirty and the litter got wet, the forks clogged and would simply sweep all the wet litter into a clump at the head of the box, so if that was allowed to dry (like it would when we were at work all day) we ended up with a huge rock at one end and almost no litter in the bottom of the box. If there was a lot of wet litter, it would become too heavy and the motor would stop in the middle of a sweep, getting it to work again involved having to clean it completely. The motor was SO noisy that we could hear it go on when we were all the way upstairs, the noise scared our new kitten so much, he refused to use it. Our most mischievious little feline devil discovered what he needed to do to turn the motor on and that became his favorite sport, he'd activate it and watch the rake go back and forth, so the lifespan of the batteries was about 3 days in our house. Our older cat, who's very fastidious, even for a cat, steadfastly refused to use it at all because it smelled. He'd simply go to the spot where the old box used to be and wail. I should point out that the smell was distributed throughout our home when the box was raking. We needed to replace the motor after only 3 weeks because the casing broke, its a complicated process that takes more time than it should since you're presummed to be without a litterbox when it occurs. Cleaning it was a bigger chore than a regular litterbox and took over half hour because you had to dismantle parts of it to clean it completely. The motor couldn't be submerged in water, so taking it to the backyard and hosing it down like I did my regular box wasn't an option, it was scrape, scrub, scrap, scrub, scrape, scrub, etc every 2 or 3 days. It was a disgusting and smelly job, and you'd end up with flecks of litter all over your shirt and FACE. My husband and I would actually argue about who got to clean the mess. Many times the rake would just scoop whatever litter wasn't stuck to the sides and head onto the floor, but since we had the tent, it was scooped inside the tent, so on a daily basis, that had to be dismantled and swept out, because if we didn't, one of the cats would squeeze between the box and tent to use the litter that was deposited there. They recommend that you use a more expensive litter, so it was more expensive to own and maintain, finding the little receptacles the box used was difficult, so we had to order them directly from the company, pay shipping and handling and then wait for it to arrive. They're supposed to be reusable, but believe me, THEY AREN'T!!! The service reps were rude and 1 even suggested that I get a seperate Littermaid for each cat. Needless to say, I told her where to go and cut my losses by dumping that ... into the trash where it belonged. Sometimes, simpler is truly better and I no longer complain about my old style litter box, its become my friend and I'm happy with that. If you value your sanity, you'll stay away from this product, its all hype with very little value.",cats

I suppose this is the price for convenience. But this definitely beats the heck out of the days of the old-fashioned mop, and the cleaner in the sprayer loosens even very tough dirt spots- our dog tends to drag in mud after we let her outside, and we sometimes forget to wipe off her paws before we let her in.All in all a great product, but I do wish they weren't so [$$$]- and I hope the replacement cleaner and wipes come down in price soon too!",household supplies

"My kids (ages 6,4,2) don't sit long for ANY activity. So, this toy is no different. I like it because it's not messy. Easy to clean. The kids like to squeeze their own paint and with this toy, it doesn't matter if they squeeze a littl too much. They can ALL do this activity.We ran out of paper quickly. I have a roller paper cutter and I just took some bulk fingerpaint paper and cut it to size. Even though the painting paper is very thin, it held itself in the spinner just fine. I prefer the glossy texture of the FP paper...When the kids are bugging me to do a craft ""project"" this is perfect. Minimal set up time, minimal mess, minimal supervision, easy clean up.

My daughter received this book with her new pink Leap Pad for her 4th birthday. I thought it would go the way of all her other electronic toys and be played with for a few minutes and then put aside. I was wrong - the Princess activity book has held her attention for several weeks now and she plays with it for 20-25 minutes at a time (an eternity to a 4 year old!). She loves to play the games and especially enjoys when the princesses talk just to her and ask her questions. This has improved both her fine motor skills (pointing to the words in order) and her listening skills. Now we just need the princesses to do a math book too!!!,electronics for kids
"The fact that you get three puzzles and a book in this one package is what really makes this set a good deal. The puzzles are sturdy, with cheerful scenes of Thomas and Friends. The manufacturer was clever enough to put different patterns on the backs of the three puzzles as well, so you can separate them into three piles before trying to build them (and thereafter keep them in separate baggies, if you want). Or, you can mix them all together from the start for an additional challenge as your child grows up.The 5-7 age range is probably pretty accurate. My son is 4, and these puzzles are still a little beyond him, but he loves to ""help"" me put them together by finding pieces for me, talking me through them and placing an occasional piece.The book really rounds out the deal. At first my son didn't seem to show too much interest in it (he has tons of other Thomas books), and didn't care for me to read it to him for several days after we got it. But after the very first reading, I was surprised to hear him talking about the stories the next day and for days after. He was particularly struck by the character of ""Cranky"" the crane, and now he refers to all cranes that he sees as ""Cranky.""",puzzles

"My son absolutely LOVED this toy... until it started acting goofy. While we thought the batteries were just getting low, the problem was not cured with a fresh set of batteries. After having the toy LESS THAN FOUR MONTHS, the Leap Pad will no longer recognize its own cartridges -- thus making it useless with anything other than the teaser book it came with.We always supervised our son when he played with this toy, and put it away in a safe place when we were done.

"There's another reviewer in here that gave the Bionicles a bad rating and went on to berate the toys as hard to assemble and fall apart easily. Well I've got a ""just turned"" 5 year old who has become a raging Bionicle addict. He got a simple Bionicle promo toy from Mcdonalds awhile back and has been hooked ever since. As of his birthday, he now has 7 bionicles. Even though the recommended age group on the containers says 7+, my son has no problem at all assembling and disassembling his bionlces. The instructions are very clear. His favorite thing to do is take 3 of the Bionicles apart and build them together into one big Bionicle.So anyway, I'm not saying my son alone is some kind of Technical genius, I'm really saying go ahead and get your child just one of the bionlces if they are asking for them. If they can put it together themselves and enjoy it, then you can let them get the rest.But beware!

"Red Alert is part of a continuing series of Generation 1 Transformer reissues. In car form, he's a strikingly realistic Lamborghini Countach (pretty much every kid's dream car in the 1980s). The only thing detracting from the realism is the fact that he's a Fire Chief's car- how many fire chiefs drive Lamborghini Countaches? His transformation sequence is unbelievably simple- very similar to the Spychangers of the Robots in Disguise line. He also feels much sturdier than many of the other G1 autobot cars, probably because he's got less moving parts. The robot mode is well proportioned- nothing sticks out or anything but as with many G1 figures, articulation is limited. I recommend G1 Red Alert wholeheartedly, and the asking price is not bad at all when you consider how much original examples of this toy are selling for.

Force Feedback (no pun intended), motion sensitive, spot-on sound effects, chrome-finished hilt, and just plain cool. My 4-year old loves it, and I frequently 'borrow' it as well.However, it appears to only exist in blue... so, when my son wanted a green one, well, it was time to ""concentrate on the moment"" ...or, in this case, buy another one, take it apart, swap in the green 'blade' from another electronic light saber we already had, and presto... a green JTL. [Technically, I also made a lateral incision to the base segment of the new 'blade' (so I could curl the base segment a smidge tighter), drilled a pilot hole in the top of the hilt (thru the now-overlapping portions of the base segment), and added one short screw to secure the new 'blade' (as it was originally from a knock-off that had a slightly different diameter).] Overall, it was a simple modification, so red or purple may be next. Besides, aren't Jedi supposed to create their own sabers anyway :-)Now, my son and I each can have one, which is perfect for dueling... or, recreating Anakin's battle with Count Dooku in Episode II.The only reason I didn't rate the Durability at 5 stars was due to the heavy toll in AA batteries resulting from the serious usage of a young padawan learner... but, that's precisely the kind of thing that They make rechargeable alkalines for, isn't it....",electronics for kids

I have a problem with the letter ""P"" block having a picture of a bee on it, how am I supposed to explain that when the question arises?

For instance, my son finds that pen difficult to use, and the cord too short. This product uses finger touch - much easier.

This product automatically ""knows"" what page you were on. My son had this thing going in no time. The final thing that makes us prefer this product is that the stories are Sesame Street, Blues Clues, Clifford, Dora, etc. - all characters my son knows and loves.

"I bought this shaver a while ago, but I wanted to wait at least a month before writing my review, since it's supposed to take about that long before your face is used to an electric razor.This is my first electric, and I was concerned going into it. I looked at the price of good standard blades, though, and saw how quickly an electric razor would pay for itself. I'll never go back. For the first week, the shave was not as close as I had become accustomed with using a blade. After that, though, I've gotten closer and closer shaves by the week. After a little more than a month of using the Spectra, my skin is now smooth even against the grain. I've gotten back to where I was with a blade.The Pros:- Shaving takes easily only half the time as it did with a straight razor.- I can shave any time, any where. With a blade, if I tried to shave more than once per day, I'd cut myself all up into a bloody mess. With this electric, I do notice some discomfort after having shaved a second time in a day, but it gets a nice close shave. A little after shave takes care of the sting, and I'm good to go again.- No mess. I really don't miss having to use shaving cream, even my nifty hot-lather shaving cream.The Cons:- Motor power seems to wind down a bit towards the end of the battery charge. It's not too bad, but it seems to take longer to shave at the end of the charge, and I don't want to charge it early for fear of damaging the battery.- This is really a minor quibble, but I thought I'd mention it",personal care

"Whether or not this litterbox is for you (or your cats) is best determined by how clean you (and especially your cats) like their box. Yes it cleans itself. Sort of. All major clumps of cat waste are cleaned out. However, it leaves little tiny ones ALL over the place. So then you find yourself back in the same old dilemna - with your handy scoop trying to clean it out. Only, these pieces are so small, they go right through your scoop, making you spend a very long time trying to get the box clean and making your cats constantly shuffle the litter all around trying to find a clean place. Also, waste gets stuck in the rakes, which is pretty gross and not at all fun to clean. For some people (and cats) this might not be a problem. If its not, then this box might be for you.

Sometimes if you just barely touch in the vacinity of the conductor it starts playing the tune!

For one thing, I didn't think that a toy company whose reputation rested on making replicas of Eminem and other sort of fringe genre figures would be able to appreciate the delicate art of pleasing the very demanding (myself included) group of hardcore Trekkers out there.I was wrong. Art Asylum has done a superb job with the Star Trek contract, and has turned out the most beautiful set of toys I've seen, toys definitely meant for the 'adult collector' range of buyers. And this model of the Enterprise NX-01 is the jewel in the crown.I purchased it right away when it came out almost a year ago, and was immediately struck by the quality and detail of the design. Clearly the creators of this 'toy' were thinking about its potential as a display item as much as a toy -- the stand, for example, is much sturdier than the more flimsy versions that have come out with previous starship models and attaches to the ship in a clever and ingenious way.About the only downside to this model is there are some fit and finish issues which could have been improved, and to get the full effect, you have to download and attach some decals from their website. None of that has bothered me much, however, and I'm very pleased to own one of these for myself!",action toy figures

"I don't usually play with action figures. In fact, I'm going to college so all I usually do is study. A friend of mine and major action figure fanatic got three Stikfas on order on day and asked me, sense he'd sprained his hand, to help him put them together. At Parts were small and could be hard to click in place but pretty soon, after a few screw ups, one lost piece, a bit of crawling on the floor to find the lost piece, a short argument over were a foot was left or right and two sodas. I had a carefully constructed, three inch tall little man. He was so cool.I started to move him, trying out poses to see what the Stikfas could do. I soon realized there was very little he couldn't do. From hand stands, standing on one leg, or lounging on his side in a relaxed pose, there were few positions a human could be in that this action figure couldn't. And suddenly I realized I'd been playing with this Stikfas for an hour and I wasn't bored yet. While more modern action figures I've seen sacrifice play for realism, Stikfas are admirably true to form. They can be played with for hours.There are down sides to Stikfas. Kids will need help putting them together and the instructions aren't very clear unless you have some experience with models or a lot of time on your hands. But even I, who have never been able to put a model together, was able to figure it out with a little help and the pictures on the box. At first Stikfas are stiff because there joints fit tightly, and yes there legs and arms will come off, the up side is they go back on easily. I have seen people who have broken the knobs on the ends of the limbs, but a bit of super glue solves most problems like that pretty fast. And I've only seen this once.Mostly, Stikfas are fun, simple toys that allow imagination to run wild. Iwht a here inch tall plain black figure it can be anything from a solider to a wizard and the knight, oir fi you wan there is a knight Stikfas out there. Lastly, I brought my Stikfas over to friends home one to show her and her little brother loved him. He spent three hours laying with the little man and then wanted to keep him. How could I say no? So now my Stikfas belongs to him. But I can proudly say I already own another one.",action toy figures

"I was one of those people who didn't have any tooth problems and didn't see any need to go to the dentist. When I finally broke down and went to see my doctor there was a bit of cleaning to do and a strong recommendation to use this toothbrush. I have to say it was the best thing I have ever done for my teeth and my smile!The small head allows me to reach all areas, even those in-between places. Although I don't normally brush for 2 full minutes, the built-in auto-timer works as a good signal that I'm done. Because I feel more confident that the brush is cleaning well, I don't feel a need to press hard and be rough on my gums. I come away with confidence that my teeth and smile are both healthy. My dentist has definitely noticed the difference.I've had my Braun Oral-B 3D Excel for over 2 years and it is still working well. It needs to be recharged a little more often (about 1x/week) than when it was new, but other than that it still works great. I do find that water gets trapped in the metal stem housing and need to shake it out. The colored bristles on the brush head are not a very reliable indicator of wear.

Ha ha.Since we have crappy apartment carpeting, there is a 50/50 chance Elmo will fall down while dancing on the carpet so my son never knows when Elmo will go down. I think this has added to his enjoyment of not knowing exactly what will happen. (Though lately he has learned that if he puts Elmo on top of something (step stool or low table) he won't fall.)My son has tried to do the hokey-pokey which of course I am thrilled about since dancing is such a great activity.

"i bought this for my mom for here birthday gift anf for kicks, of course, i wanted to see how it actually felt..... the thing was great. of course it doesnt feel as great as one of those really expensive chairs, but if youre looking for a cheaper massager for the almost same feeling, buy this. its well worth the money. the massager is generally concentrated on the back (which feels great). it vibrates the thighs and pretty much does nothing for the neck",health care

We bought Password Journal 2 last year. I can't believe they came out with another one. The voice password is very sensetive that it wont recgonize the voice if there is noise in the background even if you think there is no noise.

"We've had the Kangaroo Climber for more than a year now. We bought it when our daughter was 19 months old. At first she kept falling off the platform, but with careful supervision and a little more practice, she learned to get the hang of it. She even made sure to duck her head when entering, since the little doorway is too low. It was easy to assemble, although we needed to really put our muscle into it. We wanted to be sure every piece snapped together perfectly.This climber fits nicely in one corner of our living room (We live in a 2-bedroom apartment so we appreciate its cute size). Now that she's 2 n a half, our daughter can easily make her way around, under, and over her little gym without falling off or hitting her head. It makes a good hiding place when she wants to be alone, and the platform and slide comes off when needed.Although this climber is intended for ages 18 mos to 4 yrs, I'd say your child may get tired of it way before he or she turns 4. It isn't as challenging to preschoolers age 3-4 than it is to toddlers (the slide IS a bit too short as well). Ours is just sitting in the same corner of the living room. My daughter uses it once in a while, but not as often as when she first got it. Still, it was a lot of fun for her... For parents of younger toddlers, just be sure to never leave your child and keep a close eye at all times, specially when they're up on the platform. The safest kind of play would be going through the cute tunnels. They just can't resist a game of peek-a-boo.Great little climber overall, with lots of physical activities to explore. Easy to clean, can be pushed around (by adults), and does not tip over.",sports outdoor play

Sure, he will grimace when he opens it up, but he'll be on his way from crusty-gross nose to Queer-Eye Approved nasty-hair-free guy in seconds.It's quite easy to use, and it does its job.

He had the best time building it and an even better time playing with it.Now we will be purchasing more for Christmas.Please do not make the same mistake that my husband and I made and misjudge these toys. You will be denying your child a great experience.Although the manufacturer suggests ages 7 and up, I do not feel a child younger than 8 or 9 would be able to indendently put this toy together. That is the point of Lego's, to construct and play. The primary benefit, in my opinion, is the satisfaction of ""doing it"" yourself!A definate A+ for our 9 year old!Rosemary",building toys

"My 2 1/2 year old son is a big fan of Little People toys, but the ferris wheel is his absolute favorite. I agree the music is a bit loud, but spinning the ferris wheel and listening to the music play is a big part of the fun. All of the seats on the ferris wheel are different primary colors, so my son enjoys saying his colors as he places the Little People in each seat. The Little People are interchangable, so while the ferris wheel comes with Maggie and Eddie - Michael, Sarah and Sonia Lee can all ride along. The ferris wheel is also pretty portable, so it's a great toy to take along when you need to keep your little one occupied.",action toy figures
"I got this thing as a Christmas present from my mother. We had a WaterPik at home, but I was away at college and so my mom got me this one. I was overall pleased with it at first; although the pressure is certainly not as great as the WaterPik, I was able to get a satisfying clean feeling at level 7. Note, however, that this was the first time I had used such a device in quite some time and my gums were not prepared for it; I could NOT have used the WaterPik at the highest level without first gradually building up the pressure for a few weeks.I too was disappointed in the size of the reservoir. It is indeed a pain to refill in the middle of a cleaning. Indeed, with the WaterPik I would often go through two full reservoirs, so I often find myself refilling and re-refilling the Conair.Anyway, now it's nearly Christmastime again, and this Conair Interplak water jet has gone south. The water pressure is miniscule on all settings; it doesn't change at all from 1 to 7. It's basically useless now.I would not recommend this product, and I instead recommend that you get the real thing, a WaterPik. My family's has lasted over 10 years.",personal care
I bought this toy for my son. He was so excited about being able to watch tadpoles turn into frogs. Unfortunately that never happened.

I wouldn't recommend this for kids as they are tremendously disappointed with the toy.,learning education
"I just received my first two Toybiz figures and one of them is Aragorn and Brego. For the price I think there are a very good value. The downside is it kinda, sorta, looks like Viggo but not really. However there is enough detail with Brego and Aragorn's costume to be impressive. Aragorn has his Gondorian armor and cloak and beneath the cloak is his hunting knife which I thought was a nice detial since you normally will never see it. He does sit on Brego and I have him posed with Brego 'galloping' (Not exactly because both of his hind legs are down).I gave this 4 stars for education because there is enough detail in the armor and more then enough from the stories for the creative parent to bring a lot of 'discussion' along with fun to the use of this toy. I bought it for myself and I am an adult and enjoy looking at it. I think it is worth the price for that and would be a welcome toy for most children.",action toy figures

"This new version of the now 20 year old character known as Optimus Prime is large and in charge. No doubt Hasbro designed him with making over-weight children feeling better about their self in mind. I mean if a morbidly obese robot can lead the Autobots to victory then no doubt it will be a boost in confidence to the kid who gets his cloths from the husky section.This Prime converts from what is passably a futuristic semi truck to a robot with a build similar to a sumo wrestler, but that's not all! In his trailer are four vehicles that can combine with Prime to make him an even larger robot with different color arms and legs making him look not unlike something from ""Power Rangers"" or ""Voltron"".I doubt you could break this thing if you beat it with a hammer, it's very, very tough. It is also very easy to convert between its various modes, so junior won't be frustrated by an overly complicated conversion scheme.All in all he should be hours of fun for your little tyke or geeky son who is 30 years old, lives in your basement, doesn't have a job, and collects toys.",action toy figures

We purchased this for our then 4 year old son last year for Christmas with a mind that it would keep him occupied on the 9 hour drive to Disneyland. It did that and more. My son's love of books and electronic toys is combined in Leap Pad. Some curmudgeons may feel that it isn't the ""proper"" way to learn math, but be it as it may it creates interest in a subject that can then be further explored with the child. For parents and grandparents, the color coded books make it easy to buy the appropriate books for the child's skill level.

My legs are smooth and soft just like silk. Very similar to the same closeness you get from a razor...with out the cuts, nicks and irritation. I love this shaver, I will never go back to the razor again. The only bad thing about it is the noise level. It can wake the whole house up...but it is worth it.",personal care

While it did take a little while to put it together, it is by far the favorite toy this year! We put it together on Christmas Eve so we wouldn't have to in the morning! It is very realistic looking, and the actual castle part stays together pretty well. Definatly for a little older crowd. My son is 6 and loves it! So glad we bought it!",action toy figures

The train doesn't stay together very long - she's always pulling it apart - but that doesn't seem to diminish her pleasure in playing with the toy. If you want to get a little person a Little People toy but can't afford one of the bigger sets, this is a really nice alternative that will be enjoyed just as much!",action toy figures

My fourteen month old never had any interest in dancing until we brought Elmo home for Xmas. Nor did he know who Elmo was. Now he knows both and is so happy whenever we pull Elmo out of the toy box for a spin.Problem is, Elmo can barely take a spin these days. My son hasn't knocked him around too much and he has brand new batteries but never mind - Elmo is quite wobbly, stops and starts while trying to ""put your leg in/out"". All this just leaves my son confused and, I think, a tad sad.Great idea but one of the least durable toys we've had!",stuffed animals plush
"To be honest I was a bit skeptical about how effective this razor would be. Most electrics don't get anywhere near as close as a razor, and they usually tear up your face if you haven't shaved in over a day. Yet, I was very interested in this product and really wanted to give it a try to see how effective it was. Now that I have purchased this product and used it, I can honestly say that it shaves very closely, very smoothly, and is very comfortable. The Nivea lotion is comforting and makes the blades glide over your face. Moreover, the lotion smells very nice so it's very pleasant and leaves your face feeling very smooth. Although this product will not shave as close as a razor it still gets very close and I believe will be appreciated by most users. This is one product I would definitely recommend to anyone who is curious.",personal care

"So I'm still a Transformers fan...Ever since I had found out that the Transformers we grew up with, were releasing their episodes onto DVDs and re-releasing their toys, it feels as if they are coming out for the first time. I started collecting some of the re-issues and came across this toy. Out of curiousity, I bought it and found this toy to be well worth it. Maybe I'm just getting older, but it seems like the process to transform this series is more complicated than those of yesteryears. So, If you're one of those hardcore collectors (who don't open the box to retain the value), plan on opening this box and at least transforming it once.",action toy figures

It is not only fun but educational as well. It teaches colors, numbers, letters, opposites, music and much, much more. The best feature it the volume control. The low volume is actually very soothing. My sister received the Fisher Price airtivity table for her daughter and all I can say is thank goodness we didn't get that one. It is loud, obnoxious, and not at all educational. She will be returning it and replacing it with the leap frog table. The only downside to this table is that it will tip over if pulled on to hard. My boys are very rough and it did fall over a few times but the table is very durable. I would HIGHLY reccommend this table to any parent looking for a great educational toy.",electronics for kids
"Wow, what a total dissapointment. If this were a Power Rangers Megazord I would have to give him 5 stars. But as a Transformer, he isn't. Yes, he's got good articulation, but thats it. His normal mode is very ugly, his cab mode does a poorjob of hiding his head and arms. His mini-vechiles don't transform at all, they only make up his arms and legs in super form (Megazord) and they can be swapped around, otherwise they are useless. Energon and Armada Optimus Primes are the worst Primes to ever come out. Like i said before if he were a Power Rangers Megazord i'd say nice homage to Optimus Prime and give it 5 stars, but sadly he's the real thing, and doesn't come close to being a ""transformer"" and only gets 1 star...yuck.",action toy figures

"my son (4) got this for christmas, it fits 2 rescue heroes in the front and one in the back (standing) the talking feature works with the older voice-tech figures as well (although they wont talk specifically about the mission you select) after reading reviews i was a bit concerned that the car would be too loud but it is not that bad, it is quite loud but the sounds are not grating at all. it sounds real, my son was playing with it in the bedroom and we thought it was a real police car outside the window. the new mission select figures take AAA batteries instead of C batteries like the older talking ones which i think is fantastic as AAA's are much cheaper. all the rescue heroes seem to be pretty much indestructible but there is one thing i noticed about this toy, the claw that shoots out from the front of the car, the piece that slots into the car is bending already and is quite thin plastic, i dont know how long it will last being shoved in and out of there time and again. i would still buy it though, even if your child is just into police cars and not necessarily rescue heroes, it is a cool car.",action toy figures

After my last eye exam, my doctor gave me a free sample of AMO Complete to try. I had been quite satisfied with what I was using (Alcon OptiFree Express), but decided to give AMO Complete a chance. What a difference! I immediately noticed that my lenses were more comfortable when putting them on in the morning. What surprised me, however, was that after nearly 10 hours of wear, I didn't experience the discomfort I usually get. After only two days I was hooked. I've tried all the major multi-purpose solutions (ReNu, Alcon, Boston) and AMO Complete is simply the BEST. I would recommend this product to anyone who wears soft contact lenses.",personal care

"I have tried several other brands of epilators and this by far was the least painful one. I think it is because of the massaging rollers. I was able to do a whole leg in one sitting on the first try which I couldn't even think about with other devices.It does hurt some, mostly around the ankles. I would recommend waxing most of the hair once before you use this. Even an at home wax kit is fine, it doesn't have to me perfect. Also, the instructions recommend that you start at the bottom of the leg and work your way up but the opposite is less painful for me. By the time I get to the very sensitive ankle area, my legs are more used to the sensation. Works great on your pits but again, you should wax first.",personal care
"For approximately 6 years, I have used Sally Hansen's hot wax product successfully to remove unwanted facial hair. My drugstore was out of the product so I purchased Surgi-Wax.Before using, I read all of the directions carefully. I microwaved the product, checking it at 15 second intervals, as directed. After a total of 45 seconds, a large chunk of the wax at the top was still very solid, but it was soft underneath. When I attempted the stir the container, the large chunk at the top of the container splashed down into the very hot wax underneath. As a result, the hot wax flew all over me, my sweater and my kitchen.What a mess! I received burns to my right thumb and left index finger which may or may not need medical attention -- it's too soon to tell. In addition, my sweater was ruined by the five-inch trail of wax encrusted on it. After much scrubbing, the surface of the kitchen is finally wax free.I'm a well-educated, reasonable adult...really! I don't normally get upset with consumer products -- this really was a first for me. I just think the product is dangerous and should be taken off the market.

In this instance the ball appears to be heading to right-center field due to the ballplayers gaze.

We get him here in his Gondorian garb that he wears for the final battle before the Black Gates of Mordor, the emblem of the White Tree upon his chest, Anduril in his hand. This is Aragorn the King.This figure is super-posable -- a ton of articulation. Toy Biz, it seems has found the way to give us articulation without sacrificing the look of an action figure -- this is a toy that both looks great and plays great.The only complaint I would have is that the box says that Aragorn can hold Anduril two-handed, and I haven't been able to get mine to do that -- he's quite articulated, but the arms don't bend inwards quite enough to allow that pose.All in all, though, it's a great action figure, and a must for ROTK fans.",action toy figures

"I love this stuff! If I was stuck on an island, I would have majority of the products. It works so well! It makes you lips tingle with a refreshing minty smell. It's not greasy, or slimly, or glossly. It's just like any ol' other chapstick out there, EXCEPT this works. I used to fly through chapstick.

I don't know who gets more annoyed with this toy- my daughter or myself! It falls apart if you breathe on it.

This is the best under $... toy to be found! I bought this for my 16th month old for Christmas and 1 month later at 17 months old she is able to recite the alphabet A-F in just 1 month! And is learning more everyday! In her toddler tantrums it has been thrown to the hard floor many times and is still working! Also 2 letter tiles have made it thru the dishwasher and they still keep working to! This by far is the best toy I've seen! It's cheap/educational and Tuff!GREAT JOB Leap Frog!,electronics for kids
"Finally, a gigantic 18"" Spider-Man that can do (almost) any pose a real human can do! Clearly it has enough points of articulation. Even comes with a spring-loaded web launcher! The back and sides of the box boast the assorted poses it can do. It truly can be posed into nearly anything. But it also has some drawbacks, read on to find out.My first impression of the figure (other than undoing a gazillion twist-ties to get it out of the box) has got to be the WEIGHT! It's pretty HEAVY, folks. If you're buying this for a little one, take into the fact of it's gargantuan size and weight. It can be a good thing, but sometimes it's weight is what makes it difficult to stand.Second was the articulation itself. ToyBiz has a nasty little habit of making articulation points, but yet not making it very tight to HOLD the pose. If you own ToyBiz's stuff, you know what I mean. ToyBiz DID fix this problem on this figure...kind of. It's joints are kind of like gears! Instead of bending to pose, this figure has ""gear"" type roto-appendages in the pelvis, knee both joints, both arm elbow, foot, and chest joints. (Lego hinge pieces, or Power Ranger Megazord arms, are a moderate example of what I mean). Every single one of finger parts, as well as the toes, wrist, shoulder and thigh parts are like ordinary bend joints, and the head/neck and waist have swivel joints. ...But again, the weight of the figure sometimes is too much for some of the joints, and collapses on itself. (particularly the chest, in my case)Finally, getting him to STAND was a challenge all in its own! It took me nearly 2 minutes to get him to stand in the same leg position with just a few arm or head changes. The roto-type joints are tight indeed...in fact, TOO tight. I had to use BOTH hands to get the elbow joint to work for the first time. Getting for him to take the pose you want -AND stand him- requires A LOT patience. Standing him wouldn't upset a little kid too much, but having difficulty posing Spidey just because the gear is too tight might.Overall...I guess I'm pleased with it. But I'm now forced to question the safety of the toy. This IS NOT a standard action figure. It's HEAVY, and could cause alot of damage if thrown or dropped. Even though it says 6 & up, it takes me, a grown man, a lot of effort to pose it the way I want it, not to mention some moderate strength to lift the thing. Don't think dropping it would break it, it's a pretty sturdy, solid plastic build (except for the chest, which would crack under extreme pressure). I suggest buying one of the 12"" Movie II figures that shoot water or flip; much less frustrating for younger kids. But hey, I DO think this figure'd make a perfect statue, wall mount, or conversation piece once posed and set in an eye-catching area.-Doctor Cain",action toy figures

"I've been using the much cheaper, AA battery-powered version of this Braun power brush for a year or two, and I really like it. I wrote a review of it in that section, so if you are interested, take a look.I finally decided to give my little brush a rest and try out this big brother version. I have to say, I'm very impressed. This thing is so powerful it feels like a dental scaler. While I'm certain it can't take off tarter (only your dentist can do that), I *am* certain that no plaque remains after using this brush.The timer, which I thought was just a gimmick, actually works well. It doesn't beep at the 30 second mark, it vibrates instead, which is very unobtrusive and works well. So far, I've been brushing for the full two minutes instead of my usual 20 seconds or so (hey, I'm in a hurry!) because of the timer. According to Braun, brushing for two minutes takes off about 25% more plaque than brushing for one minute, and I don't doubt it. Most people don't brush anywhere near long enough, and the timer does make it easier.It is completely sealed, and rinses off easily. It is lightweight, well-balanced, and easy to hold and use. The integral rubber grips help when it is wet.It is pretty quiet too, perhaps quieter than my little AA-powered brush. Not loud enough to be annoying.I also like the fact that the brushes on all the Brauns are the same (except for the power cross-action brush), which lets you change from one to the other without buying new brush heads. The heads are fairly reasonably priced given what they are, and seem well-designed and sturdy.If there is a drawback, it is that you'll have to make sure you brush over a sink as the power brush combined with toothpaste creates some foam. Not enough to make using it difficult, but you won't be leaving the safety of the sink, either.Recommended.",personal care

"Listen, adult fans of Skywarp, this toy isn't just for you. I'm a kid, my brother (the true owner) is a kid too. I'm absent from school today and thought I'd kill some time by praising this incredible toy. From the reviews of Skywarp or Thundercracker, Skywarps wings don't hug the body tightly, this is true, but who cares? If you do, sorry about that. One useless detail about G1 is that the characters on the show and the toy can be very different. But I guess you must make some sacrifices.Back to the wings, The wings look like right triangles with an edge cut off and O.75 in stub added. To be quite honest they make him look fat, but you can slide his wings back to make them LOOK thinner. Also, Skywie's head is a little small and with this 1.25 in cone sticking out of the back of his head. If that cone was orange, he'd be perfect for a protectobot, shooing the traffic away from a disaster. Anyway, Skywarp's arms are a little thin, but the fists and blasters make up for it. Speaking of his fists, you have to pocket them in vehicle mode.Okay I've made Skywarp sound like a bad toy, ignore the entire first part and read THIS:Listen, adult fans of Skywarp, this toy isn't just for you.

"Chewbacca finally gets Unleashed, but it's not the best sculpt that Hasbro could have done to really do justice to everyone's favorite Wookie. The pose is slightly awkward and the display stand representing the green Endor forest tundra is fairly dull compared to others from this incredible Unleashed line. I would much rather have seen them include a display stand as exciting as the Millenium Falcon ramp that came with Han Solo Unleashed, or perhaps part of the Death Star Detention Block when the ""captive"" Chewbacca breaks out of his shackles and ""unleashes"" on the Imperial officers, or when Chewie ""unleahes"" his wrath on Lando for selling out Han and choking him to his knees. Even a Trash Compactor base would have been more exciting then this, but then again, the latest wave of Unleashed figures is not exactly the best they've done to date.

When he's singing and dancing you can press the other foot and he will balk like a chicken and roll his head and the song doesnt reset it will breifly pause do the head roll then pick up right where it left off.

The only gripe that I have is that the original fellowship legolas had TWO daggers included where this one only has 1 (why only 1???).Other than the missing dagger thing, the figure is of high quality, is poseable and is well worth a pick up if you missed the first run. If you want a Legolas with two daggers (plus a sword), get the Helm's Deep Legolas as that figure seems to have been released with all the accessories it originally had.",action toy figures

The powerful water jets clean all food debris away and massage my gums - I have braces so I use it instead of flossing, and my dentist said my gums were fine. The only problem I have with it is the design of the water reservoir. First of all, you can't fill the tank without picking up the fairly bulky apparatus and putting it underneath the faucet. I have a small sink so it's somewhat of a nuisance to do this. Secondly, the water reservoir isn't really 'attached' to the base at all, so it's pretty easy to knock the reservoir straight off of the base when moving it around or even turning it on, spilling water everywhere.",personal care

"This is a great razor in many ways. It shaves very closely, almost enough so that I don't have a 5 o'clock shadow. Since my beard grows very quickly this has been a constant problem over the years. Also, since my beard is very wiry, few shavers are good at grinding it off. This one, however, does so beautifully, and it is very quiet.The Syncro is not quite as fast in getting the whiskers off as an old Remington D307 my wife brought home to shave her legs with, and which I discovered shaved far, far more closely than the Norelco triple headers I've used for nearly 30 years. The Syncro is far quieter than the buzzy, loud Remington, and eventually does a noticeably better job of getting all the whiskers.Since I shave right after getting out of the shower in the morning I've never noticed whether the unit retains cut whiskers, and don't care. For the record, it doesn't seem to suffer from drop out of cut whiskers. And the units do look brand new - not a scratch on them, gleaming and perfect, at least the two I got.On the negative side, I went through two of these reconditioned units trying to find one which would recharge properly. An old Remington cheapie I've used for a couple of years has recharged perfectly off the same bathroom socket I'm using, and continues to do so without trouble.There seems to be some problem with the provided power cord which causes the recharging function to abort shortly after being plugged in, resulting in almost no recharging. Perhaps when you get the full product with the provided cleaning unit and recharger the unit recharges more reliably, or at least is kept recharged enough so that this problem doesn't show up.I did get the recharging function to work by jiggling the power plug so that it was halfway out of the socket, but what kind of a fix is that? and would it last in the long run? I didn't care to try and have given up on these reconditioned units. Could problems of this sort be why these reconditioned units are so much in evidence both on Amazon and EBay?Braun has discontinued the Syncro line worldwide, except for North America, in favor of a new line it calls the Activator line, its new 8500 series. It has a new type of shaving screen and perhaps an improved recharging system.",personal care

I keep several of the shakes in my car and just get a cup of ice at fast food restaurants or a convenience store and then pour my shake over that.The thing I dislike about most snack bars and most diet shakes (including those made by Slim-Fast) is that they are NAUSEATINGLY sweet. Two Slim-Fast shake flavors that I actually like, however, are the orange-pineapple and the apple-cranberry; the rest of them are like drinking liquid candy, and the meal bars/snack bars are even worse.Now with these Hot Meal Options (which can substitute for a shake), I have basically replaced two meals a day with a shake for breakfast and a shake or a meal for lunch. This, combined with a moderate dinner and regular simple exercise (again--nothing too elaborate--just some situps, pushups, etc., maybe three times a week), is actually working for me. I've been losing ca. 1-2 pounds per week steadily over the past two months--even with an occasional small &quot;splurge&quot; or two from time to time.

It's just a matter of getting used to eating less.The problem with most diet plans is that they're too darned complicated or preparation-intensive.

There have been some complaints about the short smoke stacks but they are no problem for me. They dont detract from the marvlous job that Hasboro put into him.

"To start off I have liked Bionicle since the very beginning, so I know a thing or two about it.In a short summary of this toy, I think it is very cool. I just have one pet peeve, not making the toy any better or worse, but, doesn't it seem funny that as the Bionicle storyline goes back in time, the technology gets better? Oh well. But this is a very good product. The age range for this toy should be 5+ instead of 7+, since it was my 5 year old nephew who showed me the toys, and he built them flawlessly by himself. Vakama the fire Metru-Toa, is a very wise Toa. This toy is totally poseable, and very fun. Along with fun, Bionicle Toa Vakama is very durable. I couldn't begin to count the number of times I have dropped this, and it still holds together. Finally, the education value on this toy is good, because it shows you how to follow directions, build, and have fun. So if you are a bionicle fan, or are bored and have extra cash on hand, pick up this, or one of the other Toa-Metru.",building toys

"As someone who had never waxed or epilated I was a bit leary of trying this device, but am very glad I did. I'll never shave again! It was quite uncomfortable and a bit painful the first time I used it [come on, it pulls your body hair out by the roots...] but since then it has been virtually pain free. The best reward of using this product is not having to bother with hair removal very often -- I can't say exactly how long the overall effect lasts, but I usually do touch-ups once a week on those hairs that were not long enough to pull the week before and it doesn't take but about 15-20 minutes to to a &quot;whole body&quot; once over. I use it on my legs, underarms and bikini line all with equal success. The only drawbacks that I have discovered are occasional problems with ingrown hairs (which has mostly been solved with the added use of a loofah) and the fact that my legs are never as smooth as when I shaved due to some hairs not being long enough to catch at the time of epilation. This has gotten better with repeated use (it appears as if less hair grows back between each use and it grows back soft), but it's still not quite smooth to the touch. However, all in all I consider this a great product that I'm really glad I took the chance on trying.",personal care

Regardless, for collectors like me, this figure is definately worth the price. The detail is immaculate down to the actual bullets in Hellboy's ""Good Samaritan."" I love how the figure is also wearing stitched clothing which gives it a more textured appearance. The gun is a little hard to squeeze into Hellboy's hand, but there is a holster on his belt that serves as a temporary sanctuary. The tail is a bendy, so you don't have to worry about it getting in the way as you pose it on your bookshelf. Speaking of posing, the figure can be easily placed in an upright position without it falling over. The one gripe I have is the packaging. It took me ten minutes to untie all the twisties which was a royal pain. All in all, you don't have to be a Hellboy fan to appreciate the artistry of this figure.",action toy figures

"I had this shaver for about 3 weeks and it was fantastic. It gave me minor irritation due to my more sensitive skin but overall it was nothing much to worry about. Definitely nothing worse than a blade! There is a sensitivity dial on it but when you put it on the most sensitive setting it really limits the shaving performance so I decided to always leave it on Normal.It gave me a very close shave, about 90% compared to blade but one has to know, electrics are slower in general than blade! If you want a real clean shave you will be spending 9-10 minutes with electric where you can get the same results or maybe better with blade in 4-5 minutes most!Also, to prevent ingrown hairs a lot of people recommend using aftershave when you are done shaving with your electric.I did not experience any electrical problems with my unit for the duration of use. On the other hand, the Polymer LED screen looks awesome and very easy to read while saving battery power! The pictures don't really do the screen justice and you have to see it in real.I've also used my dad's Quadra Action series which is the one right before this one and the replaced &quot;holes&quot; &amp; &quot;slots&quot; has made a big difference. Also the improved lift&amp;cut system shaves hairs below the skin level more noticeably.The only reason I returned it was because I wanted to try the CoolSkin (Norelco Advantage) line which has a lotion dispencer and boy, I have to say it was much milder on my skin. Much less irritation and I even tried it with some Edge Shaving Gel and got good resutls! But don't get the 6000 series now cause on May 1st. they are coming out with the Norelco Advantage 7000 series which has the same lift&amp;cut system on this shaver hence I believe a big improvement in shaving quality cause honestly the 6000 Advantage Series didn't really match the 8000 Spectra's closeness but came pretty close. More on par with the 7000 Quadra Action I would say.Overall I recommend the 8000 Spectra series particularly the 8894XL",personal care

As she got older, she was quite entertained with it when she realised that whenever she touches it, a different sound is made.

As opposed to the other plane kite I bought, this set up in about 20 seconds and will just about fly itself. My 5 year old niece just held it in her hand and it literally took off. They were able to fly it with 10' of line out! It's a ""breeze"" to operate, and the coolest thing about it is that when you tug on the line the bird simulates flapping it's wings. It is not the fanciest or most expensive latest greatest stunt kite etc... but for the price, ease of use and cool design- I think it is a 10. Do not buy the kite that looks like a by-plane. Oh yeah, this did great in little to no wind and also in moderate wind. The first time when it launched itself, there was a little wind but not much. It got pretty windy on the beach at times and we had no problem. I would suggest getting some additional line. Have fun.",sports outdoor play

I haven't transformed Energon Unicron yet (it's tricky; I could do it, but it's not worth the trouble when he's so much more fun in robot mode!), but his robot mode kicks butt! While I certainly enjoyed the Armada Unicron (especially since his paint job matched the Movie version), I like this one better. The cool neon green, orange, & black make him more menacing a make for a much cooler looking toy. He has MAJOR articulation (wish he could bring his hand to his mouth, though, so I could pretend he's devouring TFs like in the Movie or issue #75 of the Marvel comic book, though.). One of the best TFs ever, and, either in its Armada or Energon version, worth getting!

"When it started to get warm, I went back to get it, and couldn't find one. They would get in a shipment of twenty, and they would be gone in a day. It's hot now, and that slide is all my 5 and 6 year old kids would talk about. Well this past Saturday I lucked out and found one at wal-mart. By the time I had paid for mine, the last five were gone also. I took it home, read the instructions, and set it up. It was easy! It inflated quickly! The slide comes with two weight bags that you fill with water and clip on to the slide. It makes the slide stable. Be sure to clip them to the slide first, then fill them with water. One of the three clips on one of my bags broke. Oh well. The kids used it & LOVED IT!!!! They got lots of exercise and had a blast! Today is second day that we have used it. A clip on the other weight bag broke, and this time, for no apparent reason. ALSO, when I hooked up the hose to the tube where the water goes, it popped! We have to put the hose at the top of the slide now to make it wet. It still works, but now we have a hose that is kind of in the way, and I worry about the kids tripping over it.(...) I would exchange it if I could find another one. My kids would have a fit if I just returned it...they are now the coolest kids on the block! I would also like to say, that the slide is high off the ground, and it is one of those things that you really have to watch your kids on it. It could be potentially very dangerous. It is not one of those toys that you can just stick in the backyard with the kids, and not worry about them!Update",sports outdoor play

From the get-go, removable pieces couldn't even stay in place and pieces were either falling off or tipping over. Definitely a frustrating thing for a young child. For the price that was paid, it should have been more durable. The only impressive thing about it is the detail they put into how the castle looks. Unfortunatly, I consider only one (out of two) main pieces of the castle to be functional (and somewhat entertaining) with its trap doors and levers. The second part is useless and is already stuffed in a bag with all its pieces fallen off--and we just bought it an hour ago!

"It's a good concept but the tray is poorly designed and does not fit into the automatic litter box easily. It is also difficult to remove the waste recptacle once it is full. Because the lid does not securly fasten to the receptacle, litter tends to fly all over the place as you attempt to remove it. Yes it's nice not to have to scoop the box every night but it certainly can become a messy ordeal once the receptacle needs to be changed. This product is also very over priced.

I'm just glad we didn't have to spend our money on this toy. The Sesame Street version was given to my 2yr old as a gift. The pages don't advance like they are suppose to. She is trying to learn the alphabet starting w/A and it's on Y. Elmo pops up to sing at all the wrong places. The music is great though and she follows along w/the singing of the alaphabet and sings right into the microphone but as far as the page being in the right place when talking about the letter its not. Main problem is the songs don't correspond w/what the page is showing. I've replaced the batteries twice thinking that was the problem but it turns out it's not.,electronics for kids

The games are kind of boring and the whole layout is confusing.

It's nice because it has the little 3D thing to play with but get a diffenrt because theres no room to play with this one cause it has an ocean. Anyway whats good about is that it's very portable, durable, and it's fun to have your own little pet. It also alerts you when the neopets site is having a special day.

"I've bought a couple of these for my Airedale puppy who constantly wants to chew. These things are amazing in that they have bone, tendon, meat, and knuckles still attached. She dives in and tears it apart - she would work on it non-stop if I didn't periodically take it away from her. The meat and tendons are harmless enough - obviously they have fat and protein so they have to be tied into diet considerations, and the bone appears to hold onto the flavor long after it's stripped (she still licks and gnaws on a bone that's a few weeks bare). The knuckles, once they get torn off, should probably be thrown away after a few minutes because they are small enough to be swallowed and/or choked on. The only downside to this product is when she comes up to me and the whiskers around her mouth are a little discolored and she smells like roasted meat.

"My mom gave this set to our 3 year old daughter last year. She played with it as soon as she saw it and still plays with it every day. The set is composed of a pretend iron, a pretend putter, a golf cart, an inverted cup that serves as the hole and 3 balls.Since I, my husband and her older sister play real golf, my now-4 year old has graduated to a real putter and hits with adult golf balls. Whether or not you plan to introduce your child to the sport, it's still a good toy. She still pays with this set inside the house. It's made of plastic so it hasn't damaged the furniture and yet it's sturdy enough not to fall apart. Just make sure you assemble the golf cart correctly or else it can turn into a little surfing board. ;) When it's not golf, the cart has been used to transport various toys from room to room and outdoors.Also, even though it's bigger than a regulation hole in a golf course, we've all used the inverted cup to practise our putting.

The pads are soft, very comfortable, and feel even dryer than the &quot;stay dry&quot; disposables. No itching, no adhesive sticking to you. (Ouch.)Never mind the environmental excuses, Lunapads are better than disposable for sheer comfort.Care is easy enough. I had a small container of cold water in the bathroom, and just tossed the pads in the water, instead of on the garbage, when I changed them. Dumped and refilled the cold water daily. Then the pads just went through the regular machine wash and dry with the rest of my clothes. No stains, no hassle.

"Of all of the protein bars I've ever had--and I've tried many--the protein bars by Designer Whey (Detour Caramel Peanut & Joyride Coconut Almond) are the best.

After using it for ~ 1 month, my teeth are consistently cleaner.

"I had been eyeing this toy in a local store for most of the summer but I found the $59.99 price a little high. Well lo and behold I was at the store on Monday and noticed they had put the XFO on clearence PLUS they were offering an additional 30% off clearence toys so the final price ended up being just under $25 ($5 less then Amazon has it listed) so I broke down and bought one. When my 13 year old son saw what the final price was he decided to part with a portion of his Birthday money and purchase one as well but the only drawback was the only frequency the store had was 27Mhz. I'm not sure if Tyco offers this in other frequencys but the three they had left were all the same.When we got home his was the first one we assembled and I put the XFO togeather exactly as the instructions said to. In no time we were out flying the XFO and like the instructions say it is easy to fly but difficult to master but within a few flights I had it hovering perfectly level only a few feet off the ground for the entire flight.Well it didn't take long for me to tire of waiting for my son's XFO to charge and for it to be &quot;my turn&quot; to fly so I assembled mine BUT I strayed from the instructions on one point that makes mine a little more durable then his.On my XFO I opted to leave the assembly rings off the body and instead used the small bands that hold the plastic bags closed in the package. My dad was into RC planes and I'd learned that wings held on by rubber bands come off without dammage in a crash plus the bands weighed less then the rings so I thought it might fly a little longer.We had several flights, several uneventful crashes that night and a LOT of fun.Tuesday was a little windy and I advised my son not to fly but you know how 13 year olds are, he went out anyway. After several flights he crashed a little hard and one of the wings snapped loose but it was nothing that a little Elmer's glue wouldn't fix.Later that evening we both got in about 20 more flights before our field chargers needed recharging which I was pretty impressed with since they'd never been charged. Props to Tyco for precharging the field chargers so you can start having fun right away instead of having to wait the 16 hours.On to tonight's flights. Well tonight I found out just exactly how well using the rubber bands instead of the ring work. I'd gotten a little brave and ran the XFO up to it's full altitude (pre modification, more on that later) then I tried bringing it down to a close hover but I'd misjudged it's decent speed and intead of hovering it went into a spiral and augered into the ground. The XFO hit the ground hard enough that the internal structure spun in the body which I'm sure would have snapped off all the wings! Less then 30 seconds later everything was straightened out and I was flying again untill...Untill I got a little too close to a tree @ 30' up, panicked and hit the emergency stop. The XFO still clipped a branch and fell the full 30' onto it's side snapping a wing but don't dispair! A few dabs of Elmer's and a piece of Scotch tape (I'm impatient, sue me) and I was back out flying again!Now the only thing that was lacking about the XFO were the instructions. After coming here I learned one important thing that I didn't from the instructions, kill the battery FULLY and don't think they're dead just because the XFO shuts off! I won't go into the details because another reviewer already has so KEEP READING THESE REVIEWS!The other thing I learned byt reading the reviews was the antenna trick. If you like to tinker with things unwind that antenna, feed it through one of the body openings (another thing that's very difficult to do if you've used the body rings) and tape it to two of the wings. I more than doubled the range of my XFO by doing this modification.To sum things up, for the $29.99 that Amazon has the XFO priced it's one heck of a deal for the amount of fun you can get in return!!BUY ONE!",electronics for kids

"I bought the largest LitterMaid off of Ebay in Jan 2003 from a Seller called KittenKaboodle. It took a few trials to find a litter that worked well but I settled on Scoop Away. Yes, as some reviewers have mentioned, sometimes it does stick to the bottom and you will have to use the scooper to scrape it up or clean the rakes sometimes. Then, I just turn it on and off and it will rake everything up. It only takes me a few seconds to check for any stuck spots or even out the litter, turn it on and off to make it rake and then add a little new litter to the top (so the cats think it's nice and clean). :-) It's not completely ""no work"" but it is a lot less work than a ""manual"" litterbox and stays smelling cleaner than manual boxes. I do use larger plastic grocery bags in the receptacle. It's a lot cheaper than throwing away receptacles every 3-4 days and it's alot easier to clean. Believe me, I do not like trying to pry those receptacles out when it is completely full. You have to stick your fingers inside to grab onto it (YUCK!) and it's heavy and hard to get out sometimes dumping litter and stuff all over the place (double YUCK).The Seller on Ebay was selling the one I bought with a ""super charged"" motor (which is in the electrical cord). It worked pretty good for almost a year. Apparently, unlike the ""normal motor"", the stronger motor kept it from resetting sometimes when it would hit clumps that were too big for it. It would attempt to plow right thru which sounds like a good thing, but it wasn't. Apparently the gears and/or sprokets which move the rake along are made of plastic and within a year they were stripped. It started out making a spinning sound once in awhile but would eventually go ahead and rake. One day I came home to a god awful sound. I found the rake stuck right in the middle of the box, gears just spinning and making a heck of a racket. This was enough to scare away ALL 4 cats from the ONLY litterbox. Needless to say we had some accidents. 3 of my cats ""recovered"" and would go back to the disconnected box, but my 20 year old cat was traumatized and refused to use it. So I had to set up the manual box. I'm STILL working with her trying to get her to stop going elsewhere because of this.I took the Littermaid to a repair shop and they knew immediately that the gears were stripped because they'd seen it before. They said they couldn't repair it because they couldn't get parts.I contacted the Ebay Seller who said it was still under warranty. I had to pay shipping to and from the Seller though which was not cheap. The 2nd supercharged Littermaid started doing the same thing after less than 6 months and the Seller says this one is not under warranty. Apparently, the warranty does not extend to the replacement that they sent me which I think is a rip-off considering how expensive these things are.While the 1st Littermaid was being repaired, I went ahead and bought another ""regular"" (not supercharged) Littermaid from Petsmart. I've had it 8 months and had no skipping problems so far. I think the ""supercharged"" motor caused all my problems, but KittenKaboodle refuses to acknowledge this and refused to warranty the 2nd box that they sent me.So, overall it's great when it works, but it could use a few improvements. The bottom of the pan needs to be made of something more ""non-stick"" so the rake can get thru some of the larger wet spots and/or the gears need to be made of something stronger to be able to take a stronger motor that can get thru the stuck on clumps (and not strip the gears). Also I would like to see a slightly larger receptacle on the larger models. They are made for a multi cat household but with only one litterbox it fills up pretty fast. With 2 litterboxes it's not too bad though. I would also like to see some sort of hood like other auto litterboxes that I've seen. That tent seems like a nuisance (it looks like it would block the on/off switch and collect litter in the box.)",cats

"I know this is going to seem freaky and geeky because Depends Protective Underwear is susposed to be used for adults who have poop and pee accidents but I actually use them when I have my menstral cycle. one of the companies that makes menstral pads and tampons used to make a protective underpanty for girls who get very heavy mentral cycles and they were smaller and a lot less bulky and alot more fitted then Depends but unfortunately because of the vanity of alot of women they didn't sell because most women were too embarassed to use them so they stopped making them and I get a very heavy menstral cycle so someone recommended I try Depends and when I get my cycle I have to wear these Depends undergarments along with menstral pads so I don't wake up in the morning and find that I have totally stained my under panties, pajamas and sheets which is very embarrassing and it also keeps me from getting yelled at for staining my sheets and pajamas. I will continue to keep using these at night during my cycle but I wish someone would make ones that are actually for menstral cycles again. Oh, the curse of having a extremely heavy menstral cycle!!!!! It's a major bummer! Okay, it's embarrassing to have to wear protective under panties at night when I have my menstral cycle but it's way, way way more embarrassing to stain my sheets, PJ's and cotton under panties so that is why I use these Depends!

I just purchased this for my son yesterday and he loves the 2 spinning dials on the pop on table. You push a button and the 2 round building areas spin but not for long just through each song and then u have to press the button again to restart the spinning. The building blocks aren't really that fun they are kinda big and alot of the pieces don't pop together that good. My son gets really frustrated because he will think that he has some popped together and then they fall off. I really have to push some of the pieces hard together to get them to pop on. He loves the character pieces though and just sits them on the spinning dials. Overall good toy for toddlers but a little overpriced for this type of toy.,building toys

So I sat with a HUGE bowl of popcorn... and the dummy looked awful. His eyebrows, mouth, face, and hair were all different. I won't go into the details. It takes to long. Anyways, I heard that there was a Slappy eddition doll and I immidiately wanted it. My mom said no way, and I understand why. I was 11, and I was afraid of the dark. I could see him sitting in the closet. His eyes glowing. It would have terrified me. So, my mom suggested a Slappy lookalike, because even so, I wasn't thrilled that I couldn't get Slappy. I saw this one with a monocle and tux, so I asked my mom about it. She was amazed at how easy I got over Slappy and ordered my a Charlie. Then, on my birthday, I got him. I was excited and immidiately searched high and low for books on ventriloquism. I found a few, got some webpages, and now I'm pretty good at it. My baby brother love Charlie a lot.

"I used to walk and train large dogs and standardly used the Gentle Leader. The Gentle Leader is a must-have for owners who want to humanely train their dog to walk on a leash and follow commands without being pulled by the dog. The Gentle Leader goes over the dog's snout and clasps at the back of the neck. Your regular leash attaches to a ring that hangs below the chin (it is part of the Gentle Leader). Any time the dog pulls on the leash, his/her head will turn instead, which prevents him/her from pulling you. The dog doesn't get choked like pinch collars and collars with spikes do.All puppy and dog owners should use the Gentle Leader to train their pets to walk on a leash and follow commands. It gives you more control over the dog, which is safer for both of you, and makes training your dog to walk on a leash easier.",dogs

"Let me start off by saying that Braun makes the best electric shavers I've used. I've stuck with them for more than 15 years. When the battery on my 5614 stopped holding a charge I decided to upgrade to the 8585. It is much better than the 5614 for getting tough areas along the sides of the neck and base of the jaw. In fact, there is really no comparison between the 5000 series and the 8000 series. The 8585 blows everything else away... it really is worth the extra money. Don't be cheap, upgrade. You won't regret it.The new micro screen's shape really does pick-up more hair in less strokes. Combined with the side-to-side vibration that really does cut down on razor burn. While it's not quite as good as an old fashioned blade it's much better than any electric I've ever used. The only difference between the 8595 and this one is the battery indicator display. It shows the power status and tells you when it needs cleaning. I just don't think it's worth the extra money for that. They share the same micro screen, cutter, and other features.Couple hints for maximum performance",personal care

They even choose to play with this over the Gamecube! Lots of figures make this a great toy. Definitely recommended!",building toys
We purchased this toy for my son and oh did he LOVE it! We didnt even get home before he saw it in the bag at the time he was only 10 months but was so interested! The toy is great and is so adorable but after being played with and dropped a few times the doll made and still makes strange grinding noises i guess thats what to call it from the motor! Thats the only thing I would over all i would change but I would definitly recommened this toy to anyone!!,stuffed animals plush
"We've used this litterbox for more than 3 years now. We have 2 cats that are quite competetive in their box activities. I agree with many of the reviews...the litter does clump at times and then the rake is unable to complete its sweep of the pan. We currently use Fresh Step (we've tried them all). I hose the litter pan and rake down every month or so and when its dry, I spray it with 2 coats of SILICONE SPRAY to decrease muddy litter patches. !!Spray anything that touches the litter!!I hate cleaning the litter box, but partial scooping every 1-2 days is better than daily changes, any day of the week. Enjoy! P.S. Have you seen the power booster cable advertised to give the rake a li'l ooomph?",cats

"We purchased this VERY LARGE climber for our children (actually, for our son right now, who is 21 months...our twin girls will love it later, but right now they're too young. The price is high, but well worth it if you have several children, a daycare, etc. We needed something for the inside since we are in the northeast and winters are too cold to play outside. It came in two HUGE boxes and we had to put it together, but it wasn't really that difficult. You do need another person to do it, and you really have to use force to get some of the pieces together. The instructions are a little vague, but we got it together, and it fits nicely in our basement/playroom (it pretty much takes up all the space though). What a fun toy! The clubhouse has little barstools, a memo board, and a ""working"" cell phone. The slide is fast but fun. Our 21 month old can go down it on his own (I have the foam interlocking puzzle pieces below it to cushion any falls). It also seems like it will hold his interest for many years, and it is very durable. I can climb on it, go across the bridge, and down the slide (I am roughly 150 lbs., the max is 240). I highly recommend this toy!",sports outdoor play
I did not like my littermaid at all - I ended up throwing mine in the grabage because I was so disgusted with it. It was actually more work for me to keep this clean then to keep a regular litter box clean. I also found that the motor on this was not strong enough and kept getting stuck - which basically defeats the whole purpose.Think twice before you buy.,cats
"I had seen this cat litter at a kiosk at the Pet Expo in Del Mar, CA and had noticed how wonderful it smells. The litter is composed of smooth, compressed and extruded pine sawdust pellets, shaped like miniature broken dowel rods. The sawdust is a by-product of the lumber industry, which must be convenient for the Florida company that produces Feline Pine, because pine trees grow like weeds in the South.I tried a bag to replace the ordinary silica clay cat litter we had been using for our little cat. It is not quite as absorbent or as fast-drying as clay litter; however, there is far, far less tracking and the sharp odor of ammonia is much less than that with the clay litter. Any ""dust"" that the pine pellets might have is not at all noticeable, and my little cat adjusted to using it without a problem.As the pellets absorb moisture, they swell and disintegrate into fine, soft sawdust. I suspect my little cat prefers the smooth texture of the pellets and the softness of the sawdust to the old small, hard, sharp clay gravel that got stuck in her paws. The sawdust does not dry as quickly as clay litter, even with daily ""stirring"", but the woodsy, evergreen fragrance of pine makes scooping much less of a chore.The only drawback to this litter is that the pellets are a bigger than clay litter gravel, requiring a wide-slot scooping tool so you don't dump a clump of pellets into the toilet when you scoop solid waste. The bag is attractive and resealable plastic, but I think paper packaging with a clear window to see the product would entice cat owners to switch. The packaging also says ""CHEMICAL FREE..."" which is false; our planet is composed of chemicals. H2O (water) is a chemical. It should read ""HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL FREE"" or ""BIOTOXIN FREE"".Anyway, I'll be using the old clay litter only to clean up the oil stains in my carport. Now that I've tried a premium litter, I'll experiment with the wheat and corn types to find which one my little cat likes best.",cats

"I have over the years used several Braun shavers, panasonic, norelco, and remington. I think the accolades for this shaver must depend on what you expect. This produces an average shave, nothing more. If you look at the reviews for the model without the LCD, there are additional complaints in this area.I had to replace the cutter and foil after only 8 months. Do not expect to get 18 months as indicated by the manufacturer, it will not happen.The previous Synchro shaver I bought had the cleaner base break in a month.This model is definately far superior in that regard. I have had no problems.However, the shave itself is average. The new design is no improvement at all, and neck hairs are near impossible to shave.I think the Panasonic high speed shaver is superior to this, at about half the price.This product is way too expensive for its ability, and you keep paying and paying to use it.",personal care

"We just opened our shiatsu massage Christmas day and it broke in 10 minutes. I was very unsatisfied with the performance. It did not do what it was supposed to. Every time the motor reached the bottom or the top it shut off. It would not turn on after it shut off the first time. It quit working after 10 minutes and it would not run properly when it did resume power. The unfortunate thing is they only allow 15 minute use at a time, and yes it does fall short of the high and low points of the spine. The other issue is it would improve if you could stop the motors at specific points on your back where you need it the most. I am leary on getting another one after this.",health care

This product seems extremely durable, too, with holders for all the tubes, beakers, etc. I did see that the guide was age-inappropriate (i.e. Why does my child need to know that so-and-so was an exotic dancer before coming on the squad?), so I had to give it an overall 4.

"This is the first thing from the Peek-a-block line I have ever been disapointed in. From Fisher Price you expect quality and good value, this is sorely lacking in both. I am regretting having bought one for my neice before trying it out myself.My Daughter opened hers up CHristmas morning. I put it together, and from the start was not impressed. I tried the spinning wheel both ways, and neither seems to work right, and the directions say nothing about how to insert it. The flipping yellow thing is ... frankly stupid. The blocks though are the true let down.2 are hollow partilly see through empty with some stickers. Would it have been too hard to put something in them to at least make a noise? The rest of the blocks just look cheep. Plus several had points and bits from the manufacturing process that I had to take out the dremel and smooth off. These blocks are soo cheep looking compared to the rest, I could put all her blocks together and pick out the yucky ones that came with this wagon.She hasn't hurt herself with the spinning wheel ... but I think I'll just take that off to prevent injury. It doesn't work well at all. The only good feature I found on this wagon is that the handel folds underneth and snaps into place for babies not ready to pull it yet who will play with it stationary.Oh well, least it looked nice in the pictures from christmas when she was opening it, and the blocks can be used with the rest of the peek a block stuff. I feel like I paid too much, and I only paid 17 bucks. If I had paid full price from a retail store this sucker would be going back.",building toys

The Vac system catches about 2/3 of my hairs - the sink isn't immaculate, but it's a ton better than before. It took me awhile to figure out how to use the precision attachment, but now I love it. The number system for length of beard seems to correspond exactly with other Norelco products, so I was able to step up immediately.The battery indicator is seriously cool. It's quieter than a hair dryer, which I use as the benchmark for bathroom noise-makers.If it's time for a new trimmer, this one is worth the price.",personal care

One of the issues I have with the book, is that my son often wants to replay a song and I would like to see a re-play button on the unit so that he doesn't have to turn the page and turn it back to hear the song again.

And now that he's 2 1/2 he's even more interested in how it works. Although a word of caution. When he was teething he thought these blocks were great to scrape his gums on. Which would have been fine because they are smooth but they have the little rubber dots to contend with. He managed to pop off one and now the ambulance doesn't sound. And he did not swollow the dot (which is easy to have happen). But these are essential cause and effect toys that all children will love.

One minor exception is that she isn't able to climb up the platform to access the slide...maybe as she develops physically she will grasp this.

"I know you. You were me. Looking for what seemed to be a simple thing - a scented candle that ACTUALLY smells up the room when you light it. You've bought the cheap ones in the grocery store that sent out the weak scent of, well, grocery store. And some candles smell like spray room deodorizer which smells like what one would use in the toilet which then make you think of poop which is not at all what you were going for in the living room. So then you hit the expensive pretty versions - perhaps even in candle stores with cute waxy names. They are not candles, my friend. They are sculptures. Some fancy ones come with cute packaging and crispy dried flowers. This is when you lose your patience. I DO NOT WANT CRISPY DRIED FLOWERS. I WANT A CANDLE THAT PUMPS A GOOD SCENT ALL OVER A ROOM WHEN I LIGHT IT.This is it. Votivo. You will walk into the room and that room will smell like the candle. The most universally loved scent is probably Red Currant. I also enjoy Rain. The little glass it comes in makes a cute vase after the candle is done. Plus, they make perfect last minute hostess gifts, as the box is very nice and expensive-looking.So, Votivo isn't the cheapest candle in the world.

"I used the Litter Maid self cleaning box for a year until the motor burned out. Even before then, I had to clean out the rake once a day and pry up clumps that had stuck to the bottom of the litter box. When the motor died I took a chance on the Omega Paw, or as I call it, the Roly Poly Litter Box. In hindsight, I wish I had gotten the larger size, but the regular works just fine. I was concerned that, in spite of the outward appearance, the actual litter area is about the size of a shoebox. However, my two cats adjusted to it in less than a day. No more rakes to clean. A smart tap on the base after you roll it, and any clumps that are stuck drop right off. No wasted litter, no litter kicked out of the box, no scoops to mess with. I took the advice of a previous review and reinforced the clamps with binder clips. This is WELL WORTH the price!!!I should add, when my mother bought one she couldn't get it to work right. Every time she rolled it, half the litter was dumped in the receptacle. It turned out she was rolling it too fast, and too far. all it takes is a gentle roll just past the perpendicular.

"With the shelfspace all the different cleaners often take up in our homes, it's refreshing to see a product like PEEK. What's more, it is highly recommended throughout Europe and relatively new here.PEEK as you can read from the description, cleans a multitude of surfaces. What you don't read is how incredibly long it lasts and just how much it outperforms other products. For instance, I used PEEK on my gold wedding ring to start with and the thing has never looked so good since the day my husband bought it. Next, I tried what could have been a tougher task in polishing an old copper pot that was close to turning green. Again, PEEK exceeded expectations.In comparison to other products, I no longer need one for silver, one for gold, one for brass, let alone the bunch that are used on laminate surfaces, ceramics, etc.Finally, my husband used PEEK on his boat since the manufacturer claims it can be used on fiberglass and gelcoat. Not only did it restore the fiberglass to a new finish, but it also removed all clouding from the plexiglass and glass!I haven't tried all the uses for PEEK, but I will eventually. So far as a downside, I would say that PEEK isn't recommended for ""fake"" metals like cheap brass. These metals have only a thin paint-like layer of the metal and PEEK may take it off. For these surfaces, however, soap and water should be enough.In conclusion, what makes PEEK such an interesting product is that the manufacturer has taken the time to gain significant endorsements. Things like USDA & NSF approval, passing tests by manufacturers such as Genecos and Wilsonart, and even catering to the Queen of England.When I contacted the manufacturer to learn more about the product (which they are easy to contact peek@peekpolish.com) they shared their latest news that in 2005 they received the British Royal Warrant for their product line allowing them to display the Royal Coat of Arms on future PEEK products.A PEEK product should definitely be in every home.",household supplies

"The Oral B EB417 dual head power brush replacement does a great job of getting into tight places, reaching back teeth, removing plaque, has a nice gum massage action, and leaves your mouth and teeth feeling clean and very refreshed. The two heads work twice as good as one, but may take some getting used to if your used to a single brush head.Using it by gently guiding it over your teeth, and letting it do all the work, it will last a long time too. It was nearly three months before I had to replace mine. Most Oral B brushes are interchangeable with all Oral B units. This one though, according to the buying info here, may not be used with the Cross Action brush. It will also indicate when it's time for replacement by the fading colors of the bristles.(the box shows as good picture of new and used). Just a little of your favorite toothpaste goes a long way too!It's a 5 star product, but unless you are just one person who just wants to try it out, the better buy would be to purchase the three pack. It's almost like getting one free. My pack also came with different color rings, that fit on the brush at the base and is nice for families to tell the brushes apart. It's nice to have a spare for unexpected guests as well.also recommended:Tom's of Maine Natural Care Fluoride Toothpaste, Anticavity, Baking Soda, Peppermint, 6 oz (170 g) (Pack of 6)Keep Smiling....Lauriemore good stuff:Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion Twin Set - Total",personal care

That means that you can put more than 73 packages inside the big box. Inside the box they put a lot of plastic as a ""protection"". Very little concern about environment and energy savings. For the shipping and handling they charge you $5.29. Crazy! Second point, this product has its patent pending. That means that is not officially approved and in their website they say",personal care

As an experienced floor mate user I can anticipate when it gets clogged, grab it, sprint to the sink and dump it out.

"First, I was surprised to read other reviews about the finger pinching. My experience has been contrary. I don't understand how fingers get pinched...the ""ferris wheel"" doesn't move automatically, the sides are close to the edge that there's no space, and while I suppose a baby could put their hand into one of the block spaces, their hand would only stop it from moving, unless they kept pushing with their other hand! Maybe FP changed it? My 7-month old delights in spinning the wheel because it starts music! She enjoys it immensely. She uses her ""pincer"" grasp to lift the yellow flap again and again so that the music goes on and off accordingly...she watches it intently; I think it gets her thinking...am I doing that? She loves the see-saw, and loves to take the blocks out of the wagon. She will spin the ferris wheel to her delight, but doesn't know yet how to put a block in.

"For the &lt;$100 this is a great massager. Its massages very well mainly because of the rollers that travel the lenght of the spine on the back. Its as effective as any hand massage session if not better. The rollers are quite strong so a towel or a thick shirt would be good before running the massager. When it starts to hurt it can simply be switched off.The couple of things which i would have desired in this is to have the rollers work on the thighs also. There is no rollers on the seatable portion of this so its like just dumb seat!! the other problem is that the rollers really doesnt reach the lumbar bone of my back which i find it sometimes frustrating since that is the portion of my back which needs extra care.I mainly use the lower back setting since i sit in front of a computer most of the time and can feel the difference after a 10+minute. Though the back muscles are loosened i would have desired it to be a little lower on the lumbar bone area. other than this i am very happy with the performance of this product..some questionsI did wonder if this has heat?NO..mainly rollers which applies pressure..is it plugged in or battery operated?No battery. Just an AC adapter.Can you take it in the car? {in other words, is it portable, or do you need to be near an outlet?}There is no car adapter provided by homedics. but i have seen lot of listings for the same on eBay.How about the material, and the level of settings?The material feels like leather. its really good. but as i said above better to wear a thick shirt and then use it as the rollers are pretty good.3 SettingsLower Back, Upper Back and Full back.",health care

Also this is very small and lightweight and it really does read the temp in 1 second. You need to follow the directions because when I first tried it, it said 101 and then I looked at the directions again and tried again and got a normal reading, you need to press the button, insert in the ear, then release the button while its in the ear, its done in an instant. my 4 year old thinks its very neat and asked for her temp to be taken as soon as she saw it, but I really bought it for the baby on the way, and I tried it on myself, its really great for the whole family especially babies as my old thermometer seemed to take forever to get done and when your kid is sick and squirmy you end up having to start over sometimes. I don't know how the performance compares to other ear scanning devices, I never bought one before because they all seemed to have bad reviews, they sounded difficult to operate correctly and required probe covers.

"My son got this for his 4th birthday. While the pieces snap together fairly easily, it is complicated - no way a 4 yr. old could do it. Even following the instructions step-by-step, I found the process confusing and time-consuming. Once I got it put together, it was fine as long as no one touched it or turned the motor on. It is not the most stable toy when assembled, so it seems to fall apart easily - at which point, it wasn't always immediately obvious how to put it back together without consulting the directions. When the motor is running, it's worse. The horses on the carousel are supposed to go up and down. In our case, just one horse not working properly causes the whole system to break apart - the gears jam and the pieces start to topple over - the carousel pops out of place, bringing the ferris wheel and roller coaster with it.

"I originally did not bother getting this add-on because I figured it would be a waste of money. After easily beating my nephew repeatedly, I purchased a set for him to even the odds a bit.This add-on gives you a HUGE advantage. It allows you to do three things.1) Aim quickly and accurately with use of the sight, and keep the target locked on until they run away and hide.2) Get more tactile feedback for when you are getting hit so you know when to go hide yourself.3) You can easily play with the sound off, and act like a sniper.Basically the add on kit allows you to turn off the sounds as they add little value. This allows you to move and fire quietly, which is perfect for sniping. Many times I would be getting hit and start looking in completely the wrong direction, before I realized I should run and hide. If you don't have the scope and your opponent, and you start getting hit, you might as well just run, because even if you find him you will only get off 2 or 3 tags before you lose 10 of yours.Another advantage I didn't expect comes from the scope. Basically you don't miss ever. You only realize what a big advantage this is when you don't have the scope. My nephew went from losing 10 tags to one, to winning 3 tags for every one that I landed. Basically, I would miss 2 out of 3 shots aiming with the IRDX ironsights, while he could pull the trigger with confidence that he would hit me every time. This would allow him to sit still in my ambush, turn find me and kill me before I could get more than half of his tags.When I switched guns with my nephew I was able to drain him of fifty tags in about 30 seconds from well over 250 feet away. He was shocked when I shouted out my location after he was tagged out.My only complaints is that you get no feedback for when you need to reload, no feedback for lock-on of foe or friend, and the firing feedback makes it difficult to tell if you are getting hit at times.All this said, if you don't have this accessory pack and your opponenet does, expect to lose a lot.",sports outdoor play
"I tried this product because I was looking for a healthier alternative to peanut butter. My main reason for choosing the low carb version over the regular version was that the former was also lower in fat. Although I found the taste of this product to be pleasant, it tastes nothing like peanut butter and is somewhat of an acquired taste. In addition, the lack of sugar results in a texture similar to natural peanut butter--ie, the oils separate, which necessitates stirring the product. I sometimes found that by the time I reached the bottom of the jar, the remaining product was dry and crumbly. Although this product is adequate if you are counting carbs, I prefer IM Healthy's regular Soy Nut Butter.",snack food

"I've never tried any other brands of pre-electric shave conditioner, but I was so displeased with my new electric shaver that I decided to give Afta a try; I chose the ""Fresh"" scent. (It's kind of a silly name, since ""Afta"" makes you think of ""after,"" and you're supposed to use it ""before""!)Afta has given me a dramatically closer shave, and one that is more comfortable, too. It made the difference between an unacceptable shave and an acceptable one.As the bottle says, it is a non-greasy formula. It doesn't appear to clog the razor heads, also as claimed. I've only been using it for three weeks, so it may be too early to tell.The only drawback, which I consider minor, is that the fragrance is rather strong. It reminds me of an inexpensive after shave lotion. It doesn't dissipate with my post-shave rinse with water; you would probably need to wash with soap and water to make it completely go away.However, I'm so pleased with the improvement in quality of my shave that the lingering aroma doesn't bother me in the least.",personal care

"I've used this shaver for about 3 months now (have used electric shavers for 20+ years - Remington and Braun), so here are my thoughts. If used daily, it cuts pretty well and gives a nice close shave. If I skip a day, it doesn't cut all the whiskers, and I have to use the trimmer. If I skip 2 days, forget it. It probably cuts about half of the whiskers without using the trimmer.This shaver is noisier than the 2 Braun shavers I had before. Enough so that it bothers me when the shaver is under my sideburns. And as others have noted, the shaver tends to kick out the whisker cuttings and leaves a mess on the countertop.The good news is that the battery life is pretty good. I'm getting 2+ weeks on a charge. You can go much longer than when the battery light first comes on, without any loss in performance.All in all, I'll go back to Braun when this shaver dies.",personal care

My son was too young to entertain himself in a Pack 'n Play and could not join us at the dinner table, so we put him in this swing and he could watch us at the table. The swinging and the music kept him calm and he enjoyed grabbing the two hanging toys and the fish on his belt. Like most Fisher-Price toys, you can set the music (or sounds) to play constantly or when your baby pulls on the toys.

"I've had various Braun razors since I was in bootcamp almost 15 years ago and my company commander required my face to be cleanshaven at all times. This meant I had to shave 4 times a day. The toll that took on my face with even a good blade razor was awful, and I only survived by eventually switching over to a Braun rechargable that shaved almost as close as a blade but with far less damage.I've been a solid Braun customer ever since. Unfortunately, while consumer magazines tout electric razors as a money-saving tool, Gillette (the owner of the Braun brand for several years) has done a marvelous job migrating Braun customers to buy disposable replacement parts. The cleaning system that comes with most new Brauns is a great way to get an annuity stream from customers who mistakenly thought they could buy a Braun and be done with spending money.While the value of the cleaning system replacements is sketchy, the 7000FC replacement combo isn't. After anywhere between 6 and 12 months of use, the foil on a Braun typically gets one or two small holes. These end up giving you nasty, painful small cuts. The cutter too wears down a bit. I notice when I replace both shaving my entire face takes probably 30% less time and is generally closer. Well worth buying.One other note. This product is a great reason to sign up for Amazon Prime.

It contains ingredients that help support you as you lose weight. Ingredients that give you the nutritional support you may not get because you are eating less food. The WeightSmart also contains EGCG or green tea extract. Much has been claimed about the benefits of green tea. It contains ingredients that are said to be healthy. It is also claimed but UNPROVEN that green tea aids in weight loss.

My son is just coming into the age where he is needing to shave more often. My problem is do I let him use my Braun 8585 or do I get him his own?",personal care
"My 2 year old son received this t-ball set as a gift for his birthday this year. I was so excited. My daughter who is 4 thought that softball couldn't be any fun, until now. She and my son both think it's great.

"I have very dark, thick, fast growing leg hair. On top of that, it's awkward for me to shave due to orthopedic problems. I hoped this product would let me shave less often and, with less stubble, would make my large pores less visible. Unfortunately, this has not been the case.First, it takes FOREVER to get the best ""shave"" from this thing. You have to go over the same area over and over in all different directions. Also, you have to hold it at just the right angle so that the tweezers close at the right point against your skin. This seems simple but isn't easy to do as you're moving around.It's incredibly frustrating to SEE a hair there, plenty long, and still not have it be pulled after the fifth pass. And that's just the long ones--despite what it claims, it's not very good at short hairs. Even after going over my legs over and over until I just can't do it anymore, they still feel stubbly. And by the next day or so, I have to do it again. Basically it's the same results I could get with a cheap electric shaver.Looking at the design of the tweezing heads on this and the Emjoi, I wish I had bought that one. It just looks more efficient.On the good news side, pain is a non-issue. Yes, you will feel it the first time. Depending on your pain threshold--and how scared of it you are--it will feel somewhere between ""weird"" (what I thought) and painful. But after that you are not taking out so many hairs at once and you don't even notice it.Ironically, the area I have liked it best for is my underarms. I hadn't even planned to use it there. Again, the first time through it hurt (yeah, that one actually hurt), but subsequent times were fine. It's difficult because skin here is looser and there are lots of nooks and crannies, but once you get the hang of it you actually can get a smooth ""shave."" It's important that the skin be BONE dry, though, or else the head will skip over the skin.Forget about the ""opti-trim"" attachment. You might as well just throw it out. If it trims your hair at all, it will leave it way too long for comfortable epilating. The shaver head is almost as bad--in fact, I wound up using the shaver head in my underarms before epilating. It left the hair at a good length for that.I really like the idea of epilating, but not this product. I'm waiting for it to die (looking at the cheap plastic gear, it should be too long) so I can try the Emjoi.",personal care

I love that! I have struggled with razor burn (and those stupid bumps on my neck as a result) for YEARS, and with this I rarely get even minor irritation.

I took off one star for fun since the wheel on the rolling ship doesn't spin well (I'm not sure if it was supposed to) and I was sorta hoping for a land plate with some trees on it or something. I gave it three stars for educational values since it helps with construction and motor skills (and also helps to build future legos) but it wouldn't really help in life. It is really tough and won't break easily; the only reason I gave it two for durability is because the big wheel ship fell off my table and exploded into Lego oblivion, but I was able to rebuid it.

"I have relatively tight teeth (esp. the back molars) and most normal floss would shred back there. About 6 years ago, my dentist recommended that I switch over to Glide floss, which at the time was a god-send. Glide made flossing rather quick work to remove food particles between my teeth without shredding (it's strongest advantage). After some years of use with Glide, I felt that it didn't leave my mouth as clean as the traditional floss (which has some ""roughness"" to it and would polish teeth as well as removing large food particles, but with very low shred resistance).By chance, I happened to try out some Reach Flouride Woven Floss, and this product is a very good compromise between cleaning/polishing in-between teeth (normal floss) and shred-resistance (Glide floss). The Reach Flouride WOVEN floss (note the term ""WOVEN"" as the differentiator from their normal line) looks like an unraveled piece of willowy cotton when unstressed, however, when pulled taut it assumes a very traditional thin thread-like normal floss appearance. It works very well in-between my tight teeth (just about as good as normal ""non-woven"" floss), leaves them feeling minty clean (along w/ flouride protection), and has about 80% of the shred-resistance of Glide floss. Given the very excellent cleaning properties and relatively good shred-resistance, this Reach Flouride WOVEN floss has won me over.I should also note that as of this time, there is also a Reach Mint WOVEN floss as well. I haven't tried it yet, but as the Reach Flouride WOVEN floss is rather minty already and has added flouride content, I'll be sticking with this excellent current product.",personal care

It doesn't taste bad, it really doesn't taste like anything at all, and it's a little thick. (non-toxic too, if you swallow it) No numbing, no stinging, nothing.It's supposed to put a barrier above whatever in your mouth is causing you harm, so it can heal itself, much like a liquid bandaid... which is a great idea, but again, it didn't seem to work at all for me, and I still got some sharp pains from my wisdom tooth.Maybe you'll have better luck, but I wouldn't buy this again.

"I sent this to Norelco and asked that it be passed on to the engineering and marketing people who created this product.I hate this razor! I used to have a 5814XL that finally died. It was one of many Norelco razors that I have had for over 35 years. When I needed to replace the 5814XL, I bought the 8825XL and after using it for 7 months, have come to despise its ability to provide a close shave. Here are my comments on that deficiency as well as others:1. Even right out of the box, this shaver did not provide as close a shave as the old 5814XL.2. I suspect that in order to make it easy to clean, the cutting mechanism was modified to emphasize chopping the hairs up very finely. In fact, I observe that the debris is indeed smaller than in the 5814XL. Unfortunately it is so small that it falls out of the holes in the cutter heads thereby making a mess in the bathroom. I think this may have compromised the ability of the 8825XL to shave close.3. The removal of the AC-DC converter from the shaver body to the cord is a mistake.4. The cord becomes unwieldy to store especially in the pouch. The converter plug is so heavy, it falls out of any socket that is a bit loose. This is especially a problem when shaving with the cord attached.5. The cord with its huge plug does not coil well. The presence of the plug prevents the cord from being curled into any sort of small ball. In fact, the stiffness and direction of the exit of the cord from the plug prevents the cord from being even closely wound around the plug. This means that the cord and plug have effectively become twice as large.6. Presumably the point of removing the AC-DC converter to the plug was to reduce the size of the shaver body. This was probably due to some styling guys wanting a ""sexy"" shape. The shape is also a problem. The shaver wants to tip over when stored on a shelf on its back. Clearly the engineers noted this and added the two vestigial bumps on the back. That this was an afterthought is clear since the bumps are so small - the result of ensuring that the plastic housing ejected easily from the mold during production.7. The adjustment wheel does not stay in the N position. There is not enough friction to maintain that setting. It constantly wants to move toward the S position.8. The desire to have the head on a hinge has also caused problems. The detent that holds the hinge in the shaver body is not big enough. Sometimes when I open the head to clean it, the spring action of the hinge and the smallness of the detent result in the head actually flipping off of the shaver. Once this resulted in all of the head guts coming out. As a result, I am no longer sure that the cutters are matched up. However, do not attribute the lack of closeness of shave to this happening. It did not shave close even before the head popped off.9. Since you have designed the head to flip open, the plastic cover that protects the head during storage no longer has threefold symmetry. As a result one has to look to see that the cover is oriented correctly. That is really dumb!10. The detents on the protective cover are not strong enough. The cover wants to pop off particularly when you try to put the shaver in the storage pouch.11. The storage pouch that provided is hard to use. It appears to be too small, although I think this would not be the case if the protective head cover were more secure and if the cord coiled more neatly with the huge plug.I have now purchased a Norelco 6863XL. It works really well and I am pleased. Therefore, please note that the combination of marketing and styling has really worked to the detriment of function in your more top-of-the-line shavers.",personal care

I won't bore you all to tears by saying the same thing in some new way. What I do want to mention is that I only give this thing 4.5 stars because the dry vacuum mode is not all that great. If you have a few crumbs in the middle of your floor this will pick them up no problem. If you have a few crumbs around your baseboard or in the corners (as many of us do), this thing will drive you mad as you try unsuccessfully to pull those crumbs.

Its a little large, so I dont suggest you purchasing it for indoor use (especially since every side had an activity so it wouldnt be as fun against a wall). It can fit both my boys in it and the weather doesnt do any damage... we plan on covering it with a tarp in the winter though... before our sons go inside we wipe it down with dissinfected wipes and get all the little bugs out for them, no biggy...Now for all the extras!!!SPORTS SIDE->* Basket ball hoop, now we dont have to buy a little one that will just tip over anyway (we have one inside) and our sons love to play with it (they are only in the 32nd percentile) so its a bit tough to make a basket on the highest setting, it can adjust to the top of the house, or to right abouve the soccer net, great for toddlers or older children!!!* The soccer net also doubles as a little window and our sons really love to peek in and out of it... its very durable and there is no ripping in it *yet*... but they like it when my husband shows them to kick the ball inside, and it keeps the air flow throughout the toy house nice and fresh...* The little number game is cute, my sons dont understand it yet, but for older family and friends its a big hitSUPERMARKET->* A little ATM machine, so adorable and my sons cant get enough of it... although the older kids have more imaginative play with that part of the house* The little window alot of the younger toddlers enjoy, its one of their favorite parts of the house, all little kids love opening and closing things, yet again older kids like to make this a McDonalds drive in window or something... great fun* The big window makes it easy to see how the boys are doing inside, and it also keeps it nice and fresh, not too moldy and stuffy like some of the other houses, we like the big windowGAS STATION->* The tunnel is a big hit wiht the toddlers, they like to peek through it, its my sons favorite way to get in!

I think thats why this house doesnt get too much mold or little bugs... theres just no really dark and damp spaces!SCHOOL HOUSE->* Theres not too much to this side of the house, and it doesnt really look like a school, but the younger kids like slaming the door* The older kids make it a barn and like to pretend its a stable door, very very imaginative* EVEN MORE VENTALATION AND ANOTHER SPOT TO SEE EVERYONE, TWO BIG WINDOWS AND A BARN-DOOR...This house is perfect for toddlers, and bigger kids (up to about 10-11ish) there are just endless possibilities for this house and everyone enjoys it... I always know theres something for EVERY one to have fun with outside... the perfect playhouse out there",sports outdoor play

"Bought this collar 2.5 years ago for an 8 month old large dog (grew to be 97 pounds). It has worked great and held up until now despite heavy use, repeated swims, mud and snow. Collar unit is rechargable and holds it for up to three days if not activated much. Hand held unit uses two 28A batteries that lasted a long time when the unit was new. They didn't last as long as the unit aged but we beat the hell out of it. The hand held finally gave it up today and I'm buying a second one. My dog has very thick neck fur so I had to install the longer electrodes on the collar and put in on tight to make connection with skin. I didn't have to resort to shaving his neck as you do with some furry breeds. Tip",dogs

I recommend using a ratchet instead of the accompanying plastic tool.

This works perfectly, and I have to vacuum a lot less litter from the carpet.

It solved the problem of trying to keep the dogs and cats separated at feeding time (the cats just have to take turns eating). The heavy lawn and leaf bags work great as liners.

Now, after using this brush for six months, my hygienist tells me my gum measurements are down from 4.5mm to 3mm -- a big improvement! This brush is expensive, but it's definitely worth the money.The quad timer is a great feature and keeps you brushing for the full two minutes.

Maybe there is some big scam on Little Tikes parts and they are just trying to control costs, but the funny thing is, and I pointed this out to the CSR, when I had a similar problem with a Fisher Price Laugh & Learn Learning Home (which is just GREAT), Fisher Price apologized for the error, took the order, and I had the right parts in two days!",sports outdoor play

"I bought the Mega Bloks Dragon Mountain set for myself a few months ago and had yet to put it together. The only things that I did put together were the dragons. The instructions for putting it together are well done. They tell you exactly what you need for each step. An improvement would be some views from above to make the building process a little easier. The completed structure is actually two separate structures joined by the bridge for the mine car. As impressive as this set is, it holds together quite well. The key is to build, as with any other Mega Bloks set, on a good hard and level surface. I've moved it a couple times and one of the smaller base sections will fall off, but that's no big deal since there's nothing underneath to hold it in place. It'll take two trips to move it so don't move it all at once. Just make sure you carry the larger structure by holding onto the floor of the second level and take your time while moving it. One other nice improvement would be the addition of a second cannon. I love the idea of mounting the cannon onto the dragon, but it would be nice to have either second cannon mounted on the smaller structure as it shows in the instructions or even better yet, a harpoon lancher. Other than that, I feel that the Dragon Mountain is a great addition to the Mega Bloks Dragons series.",building toys

I've been happy with the EAS CarbControl bars I've purchased from Amazon. They're pretty fresh (sometimes the ones I get from WalMart are not so much) and I've always loved the product because they're so protein and fiber-heavy that they leave me satisfied until lunch. I just wish they'd stick to their flavors. Whenever I get to really liking one (like the old chocolate strawberry mousse - I really miss that one) they discontinue it and I have to find another. This is the best chocolate-flavored one I've found.,nutrition wellness
"After about two months of use, I have mixed feelings about these. Noticed a marked improvement in the height of raised scars (they are much smoother) but no improvements otherwise (in color/size), meaning scars that were not raised already have shown no improvement.Biggest complaint is that they just don't stick well. When you first open a new one, it will probably stick well for about a 12 hours (the recommended amount of time to wear one in a day), as long as you aren't too hairy (and I am, they peel off my arms right away). But you are supposed to be able to re-use them for several days - yet after the first day, they barely stick at all (the directions say to wash them every day with water - I was skeptical at first that this would help, but it actually makes them stick better - just not well enough). Don't even think about wearing them at night without tape - they will peel off and get lost (or stuck in your hair :P ).Overall:The Good:- seem to work well on raised scars- bandages are fairly large, by cutting them up i can cover 3 scars with one bandage- are good for about 5-6 days if you keep taping them downThe Bad- don't stick - whatever you pay for these, expect to pay about that much again in medical tape (i use scotch tape because i am cheap)- haven't helped with the color or size of scars (i don't really care that much, i was just curious if these would work - but for most people, i imagine this is the most important aspect)Final Word:2 stars, until I see more improvement. If you are particularly worried about your scars, I recommend seeing a dermatologist before you plop down 30 bucks for these.",health care
"Thought i would write a review for people who want earplugs for shooting, since the other reviews are based on people who use these for sleeping, etc.I bought 6 packages of these because i got tired of always forgetting to bring earplugs with me to the firing range. Now i keep a set pretty much everywhere. These things actually muffle the sound of a shotgun to an extremely low level. The earplugs stay in quite well (some other brands i have tried fall out sometimes). Since now i am always the only one that remembers to bring earplugs, i am frequently giving out pairs to friends, and they all agree that they are as good as they come.On an interesting side-note, you can still hear people talking pretty well... i've never had to pull out my plugs to have a conversation with someone.

"A sample of the RESPeRATE was given to the internal medicine practice where I worked at the time.It DOES take ""getting acquainted"" to learn how to use this. You must actually read the manual to gather it's operation. Once you get oriented, it is pleasant-and effective-when one is RECEPTIVE to what the device is supposed to do. If an individual has issues with labored breathing for any reason, it will be a challenge to use (albeit a very soothing one). You are to breathe along with the preprogrammed music of your choosing (there are a handful of melodies), and the music gets slower and slower. The change of tempo is influenced by the feedback the belt around your waist gives the machine. You will be challenged to breathe REALLY deep and REALLY slow. I mean, like, master yoga practitioner slow!!! Challenging. Doable, but challenging. If you do it and keep with these exercises in breathing, you WILL be better for it. I want the reader to clearly understand that although this machine is very very soothing to use, it is not to be mistaken for a luxury item or a toy relative to addressing your health. It takes time-daily!-and receptivity to its relaxing powers to obtain tangible results. The RESPeRATE will teach you the good HABIT of healthy breathing while lowering your blood pressure if you actually use it.Big expense, but you'll spend the same on a year of copays for your prescription drug. It qualifies as a reimbursable expenditure if you have a flexible spending account. If it's about the end of the year and you still have funds in your FSA, go for it!Even if you don't have high blood pressure, it's excellent for relaxation right before bed, or just plain stress management.

"The antioxidant properties of Goji Berries are ones you can feel immediately upon consuming them. They're a legit superfood, however, the price is outrageous. If you're comparing them with a dried snack fruit like raisins, they're 8x the cost (for organic). If paying $6 for an afternoon snack is up your alley, then there probably isn't a much better snack for you than these Goji berries.My only beef with goji berries are that they are BONE dry. So dry, in fact, they could hurt your teeth, if you have sensitive teeth. I actually know someone who chipped a tooth on goji berries.

We were able to jury-rig two of them to keep them operational, but it doesn't speak very highly for this toy's durability. On the positive side, the soakers were very easy for the kids to use, and held enough water to keep them busy squirting one another, rather than us constantly refilling.BTW, I noticed a review on this soaker (might have been a different color) that questioned why it takes batteries.

"The Thomas set comes with 16 pieces of track, while most of the other train and accessory packs only come with a few pieces. You have to either start with this set, or buy the more expensive all inclusive set, which is at least double this one in price, but if you were to get this one and all the add on sets, the large set would save you some cash, and net you a lot of track.I bought this set and then found come Duplo City train track packs, which came with 6 more pieces of straight track. I believe all of the track in this set is curved, so getting the straight add-on packs gives you a lot of track layout options (the circle this set makes is pretty small). My son enjoys building and rebuilding the station pieces, but his favorite is laying out the track. I think the price I paid for this set and two track packs was perfect, and it's just enough pieces to keep track of them. He only likes to play with Thomas (even though this set does come with two trains), so I don't really need the extra trains and buildings, as it's just more clutter around the house!Overall, anyone with children who love trains should enjoy this set. Also, it teaches them about building, as even the trains need to put togther. We have the wooden Thomas table and train set, but he still likes this one and spends a lot of time playing with it, so I wouldn't hesitate buying this if you think the wooden set is enough.

"As 5-HTP goes, this is good stuff and reasonably priced. It does seem to cause vivid dreams and it seems to have the effects it is supposed to. However, it should be noted that although you need take only 2-4 capsules for insomnia, the short half life of 5-HTP from ""GRIFFONIA SEEDS"" necessitates rather frequent dosing for depression and appetite suppression, usually 4x per day and attention needs to be paid to the timing of doses with other amino acids. Serotonin syndrome may also be an issue for some.Whereas many important issues are not certain or resolved regarding 5-HTP dosage and usage, it does seem to do a lot of good when used appropriately. Naturally a lot more can be said and books have been written on 5-HTP. It is a product that must be used with considerable care and professional medical monitoring is advisable due to the serious conditions it is used for and its effects on human brain chemistry. [Depression, Obesity, Insomnia] Nevertheless after taking it for 3 years I can say that I have experienced no negative side effects. Also, I have noticed reduced cravings for sweets, less anxiety in social situations and have slept better than I ever have. There has also been no sign of 5-HTP being habit forming in my experience.If you are considering using this product for anxiety or sociophobic disorders the same company [NOW] makes a 200mg dosage combined with the amino acid L-tyrosine. Many have found the addition of 250 mg of L-tyrosine to be most helpful and the product still retains all of its other characteristics.PLEASE NOTE",nutrition wellness

There was NO ARCHING FROM ANY ELECTRICAL WIRING in my home, that is always the preliminary statement placed on fire reports on scene because it is the most common, 5 electricians have deemed the electrical arching not the cause of the fire, HOMEDICS never tried reaching me, THE USPSC LAUNCHED THEIR OWN (on going) INVESTIGATION OF THE PILLOW, I saw the pillow sitting on my sofa ON FIRE with my own eyes, furthermore, HOMEDICS NEVER REPORTED THE FIRE TO THE USPSC (Product Safety Commission) WITHIN THE REQUIRED BY LAW 72 HOURS AFTER IT WAS REPORTED TO THEM. How does Homedics explain that one away when it's a product safety law that carries heavy sanctions when it is not reported to them within the 72 hours? Was there some reason it wasn't reported as required? As a matter of fact when I did call HOMEDICS, their response to me was ""So what do you want from us"". It's not about ""wanting"", it's about safety when these pillows make great gifts for elderly people. Unfortunately HOMEDICS didn't think it was important enough to investigate and immediately placed this spin campaign on the situation, but the US PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION found importance in the matter.

Nice chocolate fix. If you eat many energy bars, you know that if the flavor includes the word ""brownie"" that its really not going to taste like a brownie, it will approximate the flavor as best as it can. Fortunately for Balance, their Almond Brownie flavor actually does pretty well in that regard. It is dense and fudge-like in its consistency with small almond chunks. You could let your mind wander for a minute and possibly think that you are eating a heavy brownie.The ingredients are not great, what with the sugar and artificial junk that's in it, but I don't eat them every day and neither should most people.

"i bought this toy today as an art student majoring in toy design.this product has value. like another viewer posted, the dinosaur alone is worth the ten bucks, hes very sturdy and his joints are on small ratchets so any child that can manipulate his limbs can play with him easily. his head and arms socket into his body, so as usual with lego toys they are nearly impossible to break because you just snap them back together.the dune buggy itself is a favorite of mine because i'm just partial to dune buggies, but bias aside its a pretty good example of lego engineering. some of the cosmetic parts like bits of the engine and the antenna snap off the toy easily, but this is just cosmetic damage and nothing that cant be immediately remedied by the child playing with it.the rubber rollcage does seem a little tacky at first, but after analyzing the toy i think its a good idea, the giant dinosaur can just smush it and chomp right through to the driver!no matter which toy the child plays with you get your money's worth with this set, they'll either love the dunebuggy or the dinosaur and play with them exclusively, but legos are so durable that they'll be played with forever. i'd gladly pay double what lego is asking for this set.",building toys

"These little things are a nifty piece of gear to have, even if you have no physical needs that would require them.The balls have baffles in them, and these make a nice sound as they rotate and move. While making the sounds, there are small vibrations on your hand as the balls move.A point of note, is that you should start using them over a soft surface, such as a cushion or your sofa. It is common to lose one and have it fall when you first learn to use them. Dropping them on hard surfaces can damage them.Also, contrary to advice given sometimes, you should not shake them, as this can also damage the baffles inside.Start with two at the same time, and after some time, you can increase them to three or even four, (with one sitting on top of the bottom three).These balls really work, and after a few minutes, your hands and body will feel very relaxed. I was very surprised with the results, to be honest. They are also great for developing your hand skills in manipulating them without the ""clank"" of balls hitting together.",health care

"I gave this only 4 stars because it isn't a ""hot tub"", jacuzzi, or ""spa tub"". But, for around $35, I can enjoy a nice ""spa tub"" like bath. Yes, it's a little loud. Yes, it doesn't stick to the tub like you'd think it would with all the suction cups. However, I don't have a hot tub, I don't have a spa tub, I don't have a jacuzzi. I suffer from a painful muscle disorder, so I wanted something that might help ease the pain. With a little Epsom Salts, which you may use with this, this does the trick. When I first got in the tub, and had to wrestle with the mat to keep it down, I was doubting my purchase, but once I got settled, it was very relaxing and enjoyable. Some reviewers stated that the water doesn't stay hot. It says that in the literature, and I found that if I stay in it for the recommended 15-20 minutes, it stays hot enough. I did notice it shooting out cooler water toward the end, but I figured it was time to get out anyway. Would I buy it again? Sure, unless I can afford the real thing. It did what I wanted it to do, what more can you ask.",health care

It does use AA batteries, and they last quite a while. Its a good product at a fair price.",medical supplies equipment
"We had to replace our LitterMaid unit three times over the course of about three years. I think that a lot of the rave reviews on here were written after having the LitterMaid box for a short time. I will agree that in the short run, this was one of the most awesome inventions I had ever encountered. Unfortunately, the longevity of the product is not so awesome. I will break it down for you like this:LitterMaid Box #1) After about a year, the motor died.LitterMaid Box #2) After about a year, the motor died.LitterMaid Box #3) After about a year, the motor died because the tines had somehow caught the wire that connects the rake to the motor and pulled it apart.There were many times that we had to manually clean the box. A lot of times the rake would get stuck and return to its default position, issuing the blinking warning light. Sometimes, the rake would hit a clump of excrement and pop it completely out of the box and onto the floor. The black paw mat that attaches to the front of the box is also a waste of money as it gets covered with sticky litter in a few months. DO NOT purchase the tent. Excrement generates heat and evaporates which causes steam. Over time, this steam builds up on the inside of the tent. The end result is a layer of disgusting film on the inside of the tent which generates a horrific odor.The bottom line on this product is that it is built to last through the warranty period. Perhaps we just got unlucky with three consecutive purchases. However, it is more likely that the LitterMaid corporation is cashing in on an idea rather than a product.I have had cats as family members for over 20 years. My advice to other cat lovers is this",cats

I would HIGHLY recommend this swing, we LOVED it until ""the accident"" which was caused by the high mesh sides on the original version. I am sure that most of the old reviewers would agree with me. Please pay attention to the most recient reviews on most baby products because although the company may not issue a recall, they will go back and fix the problems as long as there were no deaths attributed to their product.

It is beneficial for children to actually comprehend that language has to be learned...and to see them teaching their Furbys is wonderful. The kids get to be a parent and a teacher to these toys.

"Overall I think this is a great LEGO set. I think it has a few minor problems though, the wings and the cockpit/nose wobble too much therefore making it less sturdy. The LEGO Group should have made stronger landing gear to keep it from falling. Overall all, I think this has great value, 3 minifigures (Luke Skywalker, R2-D2, and Yoda) for 50 dollars. The X-Wing has a small compartment under the cockpit useful for holding Luke's backpack, rebel helmet, and lightsaber. Although it doesn't say in the description, Yoda does come with a lightsaber. Another great thing about this set is that it comes with Yoda,s hut. Yoda's hut is a 180 degree arc not a 360 degrees circle. When you open it up you can see a stove, a table, and a compartment to hold the lightsaber. Overall I rate this a 4 stars.",building toys

I have a large, picky dog that requires meds two times a day, so I thought this would be perfect. The shipping was excellent. It arrived a day earlier than scheduled, but when I opened the product box, I found it difficult to figure out. It's NOT intuitive what-so-ever. Then when I finally figured it out, I discovered that the first compartment would not open and/or stay open on its own. It's also very light, so that when your large dog is eating out of it, it will skirt around as they root in the corners for all the food.The company is sending me a new one that they say works.

For us, the only down side to this organizer is that it is rather large and bulky. It's not a problem at home, but my daughter loves to bring her leappad in the car with her for when we're on the go. We end up taking the leappad and a couple of books+cartridges and throwing them in a bookbag for ""in-the-car"" use.

I hear this toy numerous times a day! Sometimes my son will knock him over on purpose to hear him say ""Elmo fell down, a little help please"". I agree that there isn't much educational value that comes with this toy but not all toys have to be educational. Kids learn through all types of play. Actually, music in itself is educational.

It is nice to have the bag, but watch your child to make sure they don't stick their head in it, like my son tries to do. It will fit over his head down to his shoulders, and he has a big head in the 97th percentile. There are only a few interesting parts...the two eye pieces and the part of a train piece on wheels...How much use is it to use it as a train with one train piece? And most of the blocks can't be used on the train piece, so it is just a piece of plastic on wheels. The house piece that looks liek a roof is pretty useless. These are easier for a 1 year old to put together, but they don't stay together as good as the Lego's quattro blocks.I would use the money to Legos...they have much more chunkier pieces that can actually be used to be creative and build things other than astraight tower, and they lock together a lot better...meaning the pieces not falling off.",building toys

"There are various types of head collar on the market today, all designed to do roughly the same thing. They discourage your dog from pulling by making pulling intensely uncomfortable, and they give you enough physical leverage to control your dog if he does decide to pull.What could be wrong with that? Well firstly, dogs really don't like head collars. I have never ever seen a dog happily wear a Gentle Leader on the first attempt - not suprising since the device applies pressure on the sensitive bridge of the nose. I have, however, seen many dogs cry, wail, claw their faces, and/or just shut down and miserably refuse when first introduced to a head collar. It is true that you can eventually teach most dogs to accept these devices (dogs are very tolerant animals), but why not just invest that time into teaching your dog to walk politely on a leash in a regular collar?Secondly, this device only works while it is on the dog. In other words, it doesn't actually teach the dog anything - if you take the halti off, the dog will start to pull again. Not exactly a long term solution - unless you want to keep your dog on a Gentle Leader for the rest of his life.So, if your dog pulls, what do you do?

"This great little device is an essential for singers and speakers, especially those who suffer allergies. (Allergy sufferers who aren't singers or speakers would benefit too.) Steam is the number 1 treatment prescribed by my otolaryngologist when experiencing allergy, cold, or other respiratory/vocal symptoms. My personal steamer travels easily with me, tucked into the corner of a carry-on size suitcase. When you're on the road presenting or performing, it can be a life saver. Much better than a towel over your head and a pan of boiling water too (and safer). I recommend personal steamers to all my voice students. It's true, as another reviewer wrote, that you can buy this less expensively at your local WalMart or Target store, but even at this price, it's a winner.",health care

"This pretty little toy is a variation on that old standby, the torpedo-shaped vibrator. Like the other members of the Natural Contours family, this vibrator was designed by a woman for women, and it shows! The Jolie is waterproof, with a gentle bend in the middle, and a smoothly angled tip. It requires one AA battery.Now, as for vibration, the Jolie has only one speed, and it is high-frequency and gentle. So, if you are looking for intense vibes, then this is not for you. Also, like too many vibrators, the batteries have a tendency to rattle in this one, making it too noisy. I tried adding a piece of facial tissue, and it did help, but it is still a little too noisy.But, that said, I do like this vibrator, and recommend it. If you are looking for a gentle vibrator that seems to have been designed directly for your body, then you will like the Jolie.",health care

It's also supposed to project the planitarium on the ceiling, but the image is out of focus until you literally move the whole thing one inch away from the ceiling. Besides, planets move at the same speed, which is really ill designed for the expensive price. My 7-year-old child is very interested in solar system. She was very excited to bring the toy home. But she was very disappointed to see what a crap it turned out to be. Now the toy just sat at a corner. Big waste of money.",learning education

"FOR GASTRIC COMPLAINTS THIS IS THE TICKETCONSIDER DGL FORM [WITHOUT Glycyrrhizin]:If you are looking solely for relief from peptic ulcer symptoms and/or G.E.R.D., use DGL Licorice only, as it is safer and concentrates the factors that alleviate gastric symptoms such as indigestion and heartburn. Also in wafer form it is more effective as it combines with saliva to react positively in the gastric tract. [DGL Wafers]DGL VS. CIMETIDINE:Studies have shown that in comparison to ""Cimetidine"", the DGL wafers worked slower but effected more of a healing action against peptic ulcers. They used 1 DGL wafer before each meal in the clinical trials.What is Glycyrrhizin?It is what makes Licorice incredibly beneficial and potentially dangerous. In a nutshell, it can aggravate hypertension and edema. If you are looking for gastric tract relief, forget about Glycyrrhizin.ABOUT BRANDS:I have used ""Now"", ""Swanson"", ""Enzymatic Therapy"" and ""Nature's Way"" with roughly equal results.

"I'm a big fan of aquadoodle. Have 2 regular mats, 2 mini mats and 2 travel ones, as well as extra pens and stamping accessories. LOVE the regular version of aquadoodle for home and grandma's. LOVE the mini mats for hotels, restaurants (mini mats are flimsy and can be permanently creased). Was excited when this travel version came out and expected it to be a mini version of the larger mat. The frame is a bit bulky for travelling. The drawing surface is felt-like and can be easily scratched. The pen is too small and will run out of water shortly into your trip. I think the pens screw the opposite direction so kids won't open it and spill water. I would still buy this again only b/c I have to keep the younger one entertained in the car and the price of $15 is great for what you get.

"We got the tote with markers and also a set of the CW finger paints for when we flew from CA to MI a few months ago. My boy just turned 2 so he is a little young by the package guidelines but not too young for the drawing thing, I am sure most would agree.So I love the idea of these markers. The thing is, there is a delay between when you color and when the color shows up. Imagine coloring an apple... color, color, color... but nothing is showing... until a few seconds, the color starts to show... it's ANNOYING! I think my boy is somewhat frustrated by the delay.The coloring books are only treated with the CW chemicals inside the lines of the pics, which is kind of weird... you can't elaborate on a picture, or even sign your name (unless you use another kind of marker)All in all the markers are better than the paints... the plain paper is better than the coloring books... but I can't say I am terribly impressed with this product. I think it is a good travel item, though... so your kid can't mark up property belonging to anyone else... it just doesn't seem to replace the fun of coloring with regular markers or crayons 100%. There is something lacking.(It *is* however an improvement on the books I remember when I was younger... just a white marker... and a picture with lots of black and gray that changed colors when you used the marker... )",arts crafts

Its very easy for young kids to make the animals (I kept the picture on the front of the box to help him) and he can play quite well with it on his own. For 10 dollars, its a great value.

"This is an inspired toy. It is good for developing visual discrimination skills in the same way that ""I Spy"" books are. The object is to locate lots of little objects which are hidden in plain sight among many tiny beads. What I think kids find fun is that they're not just pictures but actual cute little flag, car, rubber band, etc., as well as square beads with every letter of the alphabet. You can just ""browse"" or use the list and check the objects off as you see them. (If you lose the pad of lists it's also printed on top of the game). The game can be competitive, cooperative, or played independently. As it is completely sealed, it's fantastic on long trips, needing no set-up, clean-up, or space to play (you hold it and turn it in your hands). My six-year old has enjoyed it since early five.

"I read about Rayovac's patent on the I-C3 technology before this product came to market and naturally I was skeptical. A few months after it came to market I decided to try it out.For over 6 months I've been using these batteries in our toothbrushes, cameras, electric screwdriver, remote controls, two-way radios, CD players, anything that uses AA or AAA. The product exceeds my greatest expectations.Disregard the high cost comments. This should be viewed as an investment. I can get the batteries locally for about $3.45 each. Figuring 25 cents for an alkaline battery you recover the cost after 14 recharges. 120 recharges and you've paid for the charger.My family loves this thing. It completely changes your view of battery operated appliances. Not one of these batteries has gone bad. I have a pocket radio that I use constantly. One charge lasts over a week. The batteries do not die suddenly. When in doubt I can top off the battery in less than 15 minutes.We are never out of batteries and we have an entirely new mindset now that it doesn't cost anything to discharge a battery. At the same time we aren't throwing batteries in the trash can.It is our view that a battery that costs 25 cents plus shipping and handling per use is far more expensive than one that costs 15 minutes.",household supplies

It seems that the plug came undone and all the water came out! We let the chillo (and the bed) dry and then put water back in it according to the instructions. Aparently, there is some kind of chemical or something in the chillo, because refilling it was to no avail. We could not get it to work at all after that and it looked like a plastic bag filled with water (it never flattened out and ""absorbed"" the water again... and the instructions do not talk at all about refilling it...)I'm sorry I wasted my money on this product and would not recommend it to anyone...",health care

"WOW!! What an amazing journey this past 18 weeks has been. I always dreamed of being thin again someday, but didn't know if it was truly possible. However, I never dreamed I would lose this much weight in only 18 weeks. When I started this journey I weighed a whopping 195 lbs and today I am a slim 135 lbs. Thanks to Lipovarin for being such an amazing product! I recall the afternoon that I went to go pick up my developed ""before"" photos. As I sat in my car pouring over the embarrassing photos, it was a harsh realization that I had let time get the best of me and I desperately needed to get my weight under control. It was painful looking at those photos, nonetheless, it was the spark that I needed and motivated me to get started NOW!!In the beginning I was a bit skeptical to take any type of dietary supplements. However, once I started taking lipovarin I was pleasantly surprised at how much it curbed my appetite. My weakness with food has always been portion sizes. For the first time I felt like I had control over what I ate and how much I ate. I started to eat smaller portions combined with an overall healthier diet and daily exercise and the results are still shocking. Today, I feel much happier, sexier, energetic, and my self-esteem and self-confidence have skyrocketed. More importantly, I'm a better mother and role model for my children.Recently, I attended a meeting with many of my colleagues who had not seen me for a few months. The reaction was amazing. Literally, nobody recognized me and once they did everybody wanted to know the secret to my weight loss. I feel as though I have discovered the fountain of youth and I have been able to turn back the hands of time by about 15 years.It is difficult trying to juggle all of life's daily demands with the pressures of working full-time and raising two young toddlers. But it's just as difficult trying to live life in a body you're not comfortable with either. Lipovarin helped me show that I am living proof that a woman approaching 40 can regain that 20-something body. Today people refer to me as ""tiny,"" ""small,"" and ""skinnie minnie."" These adjectives are uplifting and motivate me to continue on this path for a lifetime. Although this contest has come to an end, for me this is just the beginning.I feel like a butterfly that has hatched from it's cocoon ready to experience all that life has to offer. I am now truly living life to it's fullest and no longer just surviving.....but thriving! Taking lipovarin on a daily basis, I know that I now have control over food and food no longer has control over me.""",nutrition wellness
"I was one of the lucky ones who got it at Wal-Mart the day after Thanksgiving for $16.88. Wrapped it up and come to find out over the holidays that ours was a dud. He didn't work - period - no matter what we tried. I tried calling Fisher-Price as we had another FP toy that wasn't working either but only received a recorded message that they were having too many calls and the answering tree promptly hung up on you. Talk about poor customer service! I just exchanged him at Wal-Mart today for a new working one and he works great. Ours is loud and annoying like any other sound-activated toy and he was banished to the kids playroom in about 20 minutes (the song and the sound of his voice were annoying me).He tumbled fine on the tile flooring, and only occassionally falling when on the carpeting (usually when he was in a headstand and wiggling his feet).Tigger is a great toy and lives up to what was advertised. One of my kiddos squeals in delight every time Tigger tumbles and the other 2 fight to get close to Tigger so they can yell ""Tigger!"" and get him to tumble more.",stuffed animals plush

However, the artists who designed it were let down by the engineers who figured out how to make it work.The pieces barely snap into place if at all. My son was looking forward to this for days. I consider it unfair that they put so little work into the construction design. If this were to be put together and sit on a shelf to look at it would be difficult.Instead, it is very upsetting for both parent and child. I've found similar issues with other MegaBloks toys.

They love the sounds and the lights that go off everytime they ""score."" The noise is not my favorite, but it isn't about me, it's about my boys and THEY love it! They get excited everytime! The rattle (football) is sooo much fun for them as well! They turn it again and again to watch the beads in the rattle. The baseball makes a fun clicking noise, and they laugh every time they turn it. It is super easy for them to turn (I don't understand why reviews said that it was really difficult). They don't use the bat yet, but who cares!! They pull into standing on the toy, and although it began to tip (it isn't designed for an infant to pull up on it) and it didn't break even with them yanking on it. It is made of a tough plastic, and seems like it can hold up under a lot of abuse. After reading the other reviews, I was expecting a MUCH smaller toy. This toy is a fairly large toy, just a little smaller than our toddler activity tables. I have NO clue why others are saying they are dissapointed with this toy. I have TWO 1 year olds and they BOTH love it. They haven't gotten stuck in this toy like other reviewers have warned, but I will definitely watch for that type of problem.

"And I say it as an expert on just about any product that promises to reduce pet hair shedding, or make the clean up of it easier.I have a Norwegian Elkhound, one very compact, highly intelligent, gorgeous and HAIRY dog. She has both a long coat and a very prolific downy white undercoat that seemingly sheds 24/7. It's got a cotton ball texture; tufts of it stick out, and if you pull it, you get a pouf of very soft white down that is guaranteed to stick to you and everything in its path.My former regimen was to use a rubber curry brush for the long outer coat, and (the part I hate), an undercoat rake. No matter how much I brush her, I'm covered with hair, and there's a grocery bag FULL of hair. It's an hour to two hour task, and as much as I love my dog, a huge, hairy nuisance!When I got the Furminator, I was impressed with the heft of it. I bought the large size with the idea that it'd be that much less effort (generally speaking, the small size is the cheapest, but it's so small, it would take forever on anything but the smallest or unhairiest dog. And the difference in price between the medium and large is, at most places, only a few bucks. If you're going to invest in the furminator, go for the size that makes the most out of every pass over the dog's coat.)So I tried a few swoops on the dog. And yeah, it resulted in a ton of hair, but if I just run my fingers through her coat, I get pretty much the same result.I got a grocery bag (to store the hair pulled off the comb) and set to work. On the initial combing, it took a little less than the usual hour it does. What was interesting, though, is that I used only the Furminator, not the undercoat rake and curry comb combo I usually use. In that sense, it was less time and effort.The bag, as usual, was full. But the thing that really sold me on the Furminator is how good her coat looked. Very professional looking, like she had just gotten back from the groomer's.Now it's a few days later, and lo and behold, one of the promises the maker of the Furminator made seems to actually be true",cats

It stopped my 'sled dog' shepherd from pulling against the lead the very first time it was used (She was pulling on the collar so hard that she was constantly choking, gagging, and even throwing up). The only problem I've had with the gentle leader (other than price) is getting the right size. My dog is a border line small-medium dog with an average muzzle size. The nose loop on the small tends to be too small while the collar on the medium is too big. Needs more overlap on the nose loop with the next size up.

Every time I put in new batteries the light would only last a couple of hours. I tried at least four sets of batteries before I gave up.

"The dominant flavor of the Chai Tea bars is Cardamom. Although it contains tea, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, etc., they have not really balanced the flavors, and you will likely notice only the cardamom flavor. If you're thinking this bar will taste like tea, forget it. Emphasis strongly on the word Chai, not Tea. (Chai tea is flavored with cardamom and other spices.) If you don't know what cardamom tastes like, it's one of the staple spices of Indian cooking, comes in pods with small black seeds (which, by the way, are great to drop in a cup of coffee...)

"I had this product from 1998 till 2004. I had 3 cats for most of the time (one being a kitten at first) I would say after 6 years it was worth the $$.

I reused the litter catchers to the point that I only bought 1 box of 12 boxes plus the 6 that came with the box.I did try the litter with crystals, and I felt that it worked better than just the clumping litter by itself. I didn't like the one that was crystals by themselves. but mixing Tidy cats with crystals (before they did it themselves) worked well.So I say it was a pretty good choice, except when it got hung up if I filled it too full or other reasons. I recomend getting the tent and the ramp to, to keep the scatter down to a managable area.Why don't I still have it?

"I like this one because it's for the person who's got everything. We recently got a butcher block in our kitchen and this is the first item I put there, not only as a conversation piece...but as a handy tool within arm's reach when I don't feel like killing myself with the cleaning of one pot or pan for 20 minutes. The only negative comment i've got, regarding this apparatus, is the fact that we pollute the environment with dead batteries when it's time to change 'em.Being such a small item, you can stick it in your kitchen drawer, cabinet or just about anywhere. I don't know how long it will be, before the scrubbers wear out & we end up tossing the thing in the utility closet...but it's cute, practical & inexpensive. I got mine when it was 50% off, at HOME DEPOT. So...it's not like I lost lots of $$$ whilst purchasing it. The thing comes in handy too, when you have a wine or sauce stain on the countertop and you don't want to waste time rubbing in circles with a sponge or scouring pad, over the same surface for a few minutes. It won't do the job of your own arm & some elbow grease, but it certainly does make my dishwashing job easier & adds a little humor to the boring chore of standing at the sink by myself.The device requires 4 AA batteries, which are included. At least mine came with the batteries...and they are B&D; brand batteries. There are 2 scouring pad attachments and 1 blue-bristled scrub-brush. Some people may find the item noisy. It's all a matter of taste.

"I love these Balance Bars. The honey yogurt peanut flavor is the best I've tried, and they are great with a glass of cold, skim milk for breakfast or a snack. Without the milk, they aren't very filling, it's true, but they are still very tasty and better for you than candy. However, it's also true that since they are made with HFCS they aren't as healthy as some of the other bars available. They probably have a fairly high glycemic index.Still, if that's not an issue for you, and you want to soothe a sweet tooth, or find a fairly healthy fast breakfast or snack for on the go, give 'em a try. Btw, some people have complained about the price - here in NYC they go for nearly $2 per bar, making Amazon's prices amazing!",nutrition wellness

When each piece is placed into the puzzle, it plays ""Old MacDonald"" in the corresponding instrument sound. There is a magnet sensor which initiates the music. It is however, very sensitive. Sometimes we hear the music going even when all the pieces are in place.

We play the CD when we're just in her room cleaning up or playing with toys.

The combination of the CD and these flashcards are a tremendous tool in teaching reading readiness. The songs on this CD teach the vowels, phonics, and a catchy version of the ABC song is included. The flashcards ... we both love. The flashcards are a great learning tool for familiarizing your child with upper and lower case letters at the same time, which is important. The upper and lowercase letters are on one side the flash card. And on the other side of the flashcards there are two word associations for each letter. For example, on the reverse side of the ""Aa"" card, are the words ""Afraid"" and ""Alligator"".

"I just bought this sandtable today for my 4yr old son. It went together pretty easy, you do have to push really hard on the legs to get them to lock, I did use a rubber mallet to help me lock in place.

Since my son is 4 I thought it could be a little taller and it says it holds 200lbs of sand, well I bought 4 bags of sand and 2 bags practically filled it, so I will use the 2 bags as backup! We all know the sand doesnt stay in the box for long! Overall I like it and I like the fact that the kids can stand up and play instead of being in the sandbox itself.

"The Sudoku board game allows players to compete in a multiplayer Sudoku game. Each player/team gets assigned a game board (mild, hot, or spicy) and races to see who can complete the puzzle first. The game includes two boards, two number sets, and one set of game cards. This game is very enjoyable and entertaining. Another neat feature is one player can use this game alone. Since the boards do not require a game card to work, the number of games is un-limited and can come from many different sources (books, magazines, website, etc), which requires you to place the given numbers yourself.

When it gets warmer outside, we'll put her swim suit on and try it with water. I'm sure it'll be a ""splash""! I'm also interested in trying the table with dry macaroni/ dry rice instead of sand, as suggested in other reviews.The only problem I have with this toy is it comes with two boats, two small sand buckets but only ONE sand shovel. If you have more than one child, you'll need to be prepared with another shovel.The table is long, so there is plenty of room for several kids!!! I also like that the barrier between the sand side, and the water side is high and thick, so the sand and water won't easily become mixed while playing, although we both know it's going to happen anyway, right? :)I put this toy together in about 30 minutes (a power drill is a must!).

LIpovarin also seemed to curb my appetite and i didnt have the urge to snack during the day which also helped me since i was a big carb snacker at work. The second week I lost another 3 lbs which i was still very pleased about. I also started to notice a slight chang ein my waist area. It seemed to me that my jeans were fitting better too. My husband also noticed this as well.The 3rd week I lost another 3lbs and although i wanted to keep losing more weight each week i was very happy to maintain what i was doing. My workouts were going very well and i was following my diet very well at this point. The fourth week I slipped a little because of Thanksgiving and I ate more than i wanted to but you all know what happens when the family gets together and everything looks so GOOD to eat! Well i only lost one pound that week but i think it was all due to Turkey day.The 5th week (i was on my second bottle at this point) I really started to see some better increase in the weight loss as I lost 6lbs that week alone! I picked up the cardio a little in the gym because i was upset that i let myself go on thanksgiving and it really showed. Lipovarin was giving me good energy throughout the day and i couldnt be doing what i was doing without it. I actually looked forward to going to the gym and the best part was feeling energized on my way there. I used to dread going to the gym without and energy and just hoping a morning cup of coffee was going to get me going. The diet was back on track and i was eating a stedy flow of chicken salads, tuna, and chicken sandwiches and trying to stay away from late nights eating and drinking lots of fluids.The 6th week I dropped 5 lbs and there was a noticable difference in my body and all my friends and co-workers really started to notice as the compliments were flowing in. This is the best part of dieting and really makes you feel good when compliments are being thrown at you. At this point I have lost over 23 lbs and was well on my way to my goal of 40lbs lost. I was fearful of hitting a plateau and didnt want to do that so i tried a new diet plan which consisted of new foods and it seemed to spark my weight loss more! I added in a protein shake and that helped to increase my protein intake.The next week I lost another 5lbs and actually measured my waist to my surprise i had lost over 3 inches on my waist!! I was so excited to be able to fit into some of my older jeans. I tell you that the best feeling is to look into the mirror and just be able to stare and wonder who that new perons is standing in front of you. I was almost at my goal and was so crazy to get there. I was going to stop at nothing till i reached it. The following week I hit a personal best and lost 7lbs that week! I so focused in the gym and i looked forward to every workout. I added in an extra 30 min on the stair master after my normal hour of treadmill. This was actaully very easy to do as i was in good cardio shape now. I was almost at my goal and was getting very excited and i was going to reach my holiday goal of 40 lbs lost. The next week I only lost 2lbs but it was still positive so i was not complaining (upset but you know the deal). I was almost there but the holidays were right around the corner. I sucked it up and kept myself focused and mid-week i weighed in and had reached my 40lb lost goal! I couldnt believe myself and my hubby was soooo proud of me. At this point 3 of my friends are now on Lipovarin and 2 of my male co-workers so this stuff is great. Everyone should try Lipovarin and stay with it because you can get the same results i had and you will love it!!",nutrition wellness

"The three Turkish Angoras in my house think these tunnels are ""the bomb"". We have hooked three of them together and the feline ""children"" love to run through the tunnels and pop out of the other end and pounce on unsuspecting siblings or human parents. The felines also like to run across the top the tunnel, sort of trampoline style. I don't know if all cats will do that though, my ""kids"" are little (5, 7 and 8 pounds). They also enjoy attacking the furry balls that are attached to the interior with string. We frequently find the tunnel rolling along the floor as the play with the interior balls. We have had this product for 4 years and the ""kids"" have not lost interest in their toy yet.On the down side the tunnels are a problem to clean on the inside. The only thing that I have found to get the cat hair out of the inside is the vacuum cleaner. If you don't own a canister vac, I would try a damp sponge. The exterior of the tunnel is nylon and can be wiped clean if it gets soiled.Cleaning issue aside since cats rule in my home we give this product three paws up.Feline recommended and mommy approved.",cats

"Although I have used many electronic cuff devices in the past, this is one of the worst at providing accurate readings.Firstly, the cuff is not adequate for very small or larger wrists and the readings are often lower than what you would get if the blood pressure were taken manually the traditional way.In a clinical setting, it is important that you get adequate readings so that the patient can receive the proper treatment based on their readings. It is imperative since you may or may not give medication depending on what you recive via the blood pressure measurement. I have taken a blood pressure manually after getting what I considered a questionable reading only to discover that the wrist blood pressure was far too low and more aggressive measures had to be taken because of the data that was retrieved the old fashioned way. Imagine had I taken the initial reading as truth and the patient may have had a stroke as a result.As a rule, I never recommend using these devices for at home use because of the risk of false readings. Many people who suffer from hypertension feel that this is a good way of monitoring their blood pressure when in actuality it is giving them a false sense of security.If you are considering buying this product for at home use or for use in a clinical setting, please ask your doctor or nurse for their opinions.",medical supplies equipment

I've read that Cascara Sagrada is also safe for small children. However, anything stronger than 425 mgs might cause abdominal pain.

"Apparently Walk-Fit Orthotics may come in different sizes, but they only come in one width. I wear EE shoes (way wider than most women!). I did not at first realize that the Walk Fits were too wide, but I did notice that my feet felt like they were tilting to the outside. I attributed the tilt to the ""Breaking-In Phase."" Of course, the only thing that broke was my alignment (several costly trips to the chiropractor have NOT remediated the situation).When I finally took a closer look (unfortunately, it was a few week later), I realized that the orthotics were actually tilted inside my shoe because they were slightly wider than my shoe. I had a friend with a C width shoe try them on; well, she never acutally got to try them on because they did not even begin to fit inside her shoe. Since the average woman's shoe width is B, most women cannot begin to wear the Walk-fit. Now, they can send it right back for a full refund - minus shipping and handling of course (probably a great money-maker for the company right there).I have heard comments about the difficulty of trying to return products to Walk-Fit. They are true! Maybe a few lucky souls get their money back, but the company just won't do it - they have several reasons why they don't have to. I consider the company to engage in false advertising - the product is not for women, but the infomercials do not say that. I'm going to contact my State's Attorney's Office to report fraudulent practices. I suggest all other unhappy consumers do the same.",health care
"You've got to question reviews that claim how this little device is ""accurate."" How do you know it's accurate? Compared to what? If this is your only device to measure your body fat percentage, how do you know it's correct? I know my bathroom scale is accurate because I can compare the results to a medical scale used at my gym or the doctor's office. What they probably mean is that it's consistent, not accurate.So unless you have been dunked in water for a body fat test to measure your water displacement or via some other proven method, it's difficult to say that this device is accurate. With that aside, I can say that this device delivers consistent results if you follow the instructions. It is also very well-made. The instructions are straightforward, it is easy to use, and the display is easy to view. As to the accuracy, I can only say after I have something to compare it to.*** January 2010 Update ***Since my original review, I've purchased the full-body Omron (much more expensive) body fat analyzer that is built into the scale with the foot sensors and attached hand grip sensors.

"The device seems to work, but the accompanying software and directions for its use are abysmal. I am a former software engineer, and it still took me considerable time playing with the software and the USB connection to get things to work. The directions for using the PC-Link are basically useless. The directions don't even tell a user that he must set the unit to PC-Link to start transmissions. This may be obvious to someone with a software background, but I'd be willing to bet that it's not obvious to the typical user.The unit can handle up to two users, and my wife and I both use it. However, it is very easy to forget to set it to the correct user before taking the measurement. That, of course, fouls up the stored set of measurements, and there appears to be no way to correct such a mistake. The unit has no warnings or safeguards to make sure that you are set on the correct user when taking a measurement.Also, the batteries do not last very longOh, yes, after uninstalling and installing the software three times, the install software neglected to put the help files (not very useful anyway) in place on the hard drive.All in all, I would not recommend this unit. It was a great idea. Taking your blood pressure from the wrist is certainly more convenient and being able to download to your PC and plot data is a great idea.

This machine is incredibly inexpensive, and you don't have to go broke supplying batteries for it, because it comes with its own AC plug.Another great feature is the timer. You can set it for 15, 30 or 60 minutes. And of course, there is a volume control. I also like the design. It is compact, but stable, and not likely to get knocked over very easily. It could be placed on an unstable surface like the carpet, or, in my case, a pile of books on my nightstand.I don't like the heartbeat sound, but I've fallen asleep quite well to all of the other sounds. My favorite is the ""Rain"" sound - very consistent and soothing.My only complaint is the sound quality. I would rate it as average - I've heard better, and I've heard worse. The sounds are repetitive, with only about a minute long cycle.And my reason for not giving it five stars is that when you turn the sound up past a certain level (not even to the halfway point on the volume control), there is a feedback buzz. Lucky for me, there is room on my nightstand right next to my bed, so I can hear it on the lower levels.

The treats for my other cats are so not to show favoritism, but they still think Kushka is getting the best treat (but since other treats are only around a dollar a package, the pill pockets are only for pills).

I had never had to give her a pill before she was diagnosed with CRF 2 months ago, she had never been sick before in all 12 years of her life.

"I bought three of these collars for my cats because we're moving and I want them to have IDs.In the past, I've tried the wider collars with the safety snap. When I put those on, the cats would wiggle and squirm trying to get the collar off and with the safety snap they eventually unlatched them. Plus, the width of other collars tends to mat the hair around their necks.This collar, so far, is far superior. Two of my cats were hesitant about having something go over their head, but once the Safety Collar was on, they haven't thought twice about it. They haven't tried to get them off or scratched at them, it doesn't seem to bother them at all and since these collars are so thin, the fur on their necks aren't suffering.The sliding motion of the collar is easy to move back and forth yet secure enough to stay in place with regular use. The colors are very vibrant. I got Mango Orange, Maui Blue, and Tulip Red but unfortunately, since my cats have long hair the color gets lost in their fur.

You WILL have some smell (far less smell than leaving animal waste all over the yard) and, unfortunately, some flies (Again, the flies concentarte in one place - versus all over your yard.) You DO have to dig a hole - the bigger the better (boo-hoo to the other customer that complained) It works. Period. If you are in a zone where the temperature freezes alot - probably NOT a good idea. Great for multiple dogs.",dogs
"that's the rule of thumb! As they advertise, if you apply this on fresh stains, it removes most of them. I love whites, especially in summer, but have been scared of wearing them since I'm a bit on the clumsy side. But with Tide to Go, I risk wearing whites, and guess what, I don't regret it. The types of stains (read fresh stains) it has helped me with so far include:coffee stains (have to use it a bit more so that it doesn't spread)pizza sauce stains (don't ask me how)soda stains (specifically cola)oily food stainsThe reason why I've given it 4 stars is because sometimes, especially if it's an oily food stain, rubbing over and over doesn't necessarily remove it, only makes it lighter. Thus, not 100% on those kinds of stains. But overall, it's the best one available in the market so far.",household supplies

"I ordered this smart glove for my Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. Before the wrist support, I used to move my wrist too vigorously using the mouse or even doing other tasks and things would pop out of joint.So I needed a wrist brace that would support, and allow normal range of movement-- but no *more* than normal range of movement.This glove does the trick nicely. I can type and mouse freely, but it gently reminds my wrist of the position it should be in.It *does* take a bit of getting used to. The bean bag in the palm annoyed me to begin with, now I see that it really does help eliminate strain when typing. You have to wear it a bit and sort of crunch it into position though. Also, the supports/splints in the thumb are a little long for my tastes, and I have to be sure that it's not rubbing because I bruise easily (again thanks to the EDS). So far really, though, no troubles with that.I would recommend this, not to alleviate pain so much, but as a preventative measure from doing more damage.",medical supplies equipment
"I first bought the Cookies N' Cream version of the Optimum whey. It gave me great results by helping speed up my recovery time, and I truly did notice a difference in my muscle development after starting to use it. However, the taste of Cookies n' Cream isn't really that great and small cookie bits can be annoying. However, I later tried the double chocolate flavor and it really does taste like real chocolate, and is something you can really enjoy. But in the end I guess it's all about personal taste, it seems that some of the other reviewers liked the cookies n' cream but not the chocolate.On a side note; Taking protien shakes does not develop your muscles, or give them an complexion or even make you bigger. It all depends on the type of workout you have. You grow outside of the gym not inside the gym, however, muscles need to be repaired after a good workoutm and that's what protiens do.

I don't know if the weight loss was due to the walking or the green tea, or the combination, but I do suggest trying this routine.

"Knowing how much our three year old would enjoy having a swing set of his own, we searched and finally decided on this set for both the features and the price.We purchased the Verona Swing Set at Toys R Us and attempted to assemble the set this afternoon. We had extreme difficulty in navigating the assembly process due to the incomplete and poorly designed instruction manual.There is no reference as to which side the support bars should be placed, no reference to the bushings for the glider, as well as incomplete instructions in how to attach the slide to the frame.During the frustrating journey of putting together our son's birthday present (the swing set), we also found that we were missing the front leg for the slide and couldn't even complete the ordeal of assembly. It took us over 2 hours to get to this point!!The only way that we were able to figure out how the slide was attached to the frame, was to go online and look at the owner's manual and instructions (the one online was updated 4/2006, the one provided provided stated that it was revised in 11/2005).We had to zoom into the provided picture of the completed set because even the updated manual has no further explanations as to how the link bars are attached to the slide. We finally decided that the link bars must attach parallel to the support bar and the slide affixes ahead of the holes in the support bar, not even with them as we assumed.I sincerely hope that the other reviews are correct in that the product is well worth the frustration of the assembly and that it will last and provide many hours of fun for my son. The only additional downfall is that now I have to order and wait on the missing part, so that my son can actually use his new slide.",sports outdoor play

The ""walls"" on top and around the sides and front make it really easy to see what is going on inside the crate. I bought the small, which gives him plenty of room to move around.

Walking two dogs that weigh almost 40 - 50 lbs each was quite the ordeal when they decided (as they often did) to go in different directions. I've notice a few negative reviews around the fit, etc. I watched the dvd prior to trying it and didn't seem to have any difficulting finding a good fit for my dogs. Each were trained separately on the collars and the difference between walking them now is like night and day. We now take them regularly to parks and have even gone on several vacations. Walking with the collars on is easy, and the dogs can easily open their mouths and drink, bark, or take treats. Again, I'm only speaking from my own experience, but the dogs are very eager to put on the collars anytime we go out now... and what used to be an ordeal is now a pleasure. Just my two cents.

"The PowerMop replaces a sponge mop, not a regular mop, in terms of what it can do. If you currently use a sponge mop, you will love this, as it solves the sponge mop problem (the dirty sponge that is hard to clean and expensive to replace). If you use a regular mop, this will be a disappointment. It is, however, much lighter and less effortful than a regular mop. If you have a few additional tools, and a fairly small surface area to clean (as in an apartment), you may want to consider it.Those with more than 200 sq. ft. of flooring to clean probably need to stick with more conventional means.In a nutshell, the Pros:-great for light cleaning of small spaces-fits well with a cleaning routine based on a Roomba-fits around toilets and costs less than Scooba, even with the supplies-great replacement for a sponge mop-carry a bottle of 409 with you, and many of the stained spots will come cleanThe Cons:-easy jobs are easy with the power mop, but difficult jobs are still difficult (it does not solve all problems)-need to go over the floor (quickly) multiple times for effective cleaning-disposable parts are expensive-cleaning solution is not the best possible-unlike their competitor, they don't allow you to refill the solution bottle with whatever you like-will require multiple pads for large floors, making it significantly more expensive for a house than an apartmentThe floor does need to be swept or, better, vacuumed before it is mopped. We have a Roomba, and so I find it convenient to send the Roomba around the kitchen first (while I'm doing something else), and then come back to mop afterwards. Those of you already in the habit of vacuuming your hard floors before you mop will have to do the same step.The power mop works best for me in multiple quick steps, rather than going over each piece of floor until it is completely clean. Quickly run the mop while squirting over the whole floor, then come back around again. The extra time allows the dirt to loosen up, so it's more efficient than going over each spot multiple times before moving on. This is very different than how most people mop, so it requires a change in habits.There is no heaviness, no bending, no dirty water, no smearing dirt around, and each step is very, very fast.",household supplies

"Well here is my review on the Clone Scout Walker. For those of you who don't know, this machine's real name is the AT-RT.This is one of those ""meh"" sets.First of all, let me point out that the set is WAY bigger than it should be. The AT-RT is the height of two clones. This is about twice the size of the movie version then. The head is wrong as well. But hey, nothing a simple modding can do. Overall, the set itself looks pretty nice and is fairly simple to build. Mind you, it is not the most durable set, but we have all seen worse.I do, however, like the fact that on the side of the walker, there is an opening where you can put the clone's ""blaster rifle"" in. This makes for easy displaying. Apparently a long time ago, bullhorns could be used as ranged weapons.The clone itself is actually out of place in this set. If you own the Clone Turbo Tank, switch the green trooper with the red one in this set. If you don't, don't worry about it. The set is ok either way. The clone is extremely well down in my opinion. Lego always seems to outdue themselves with the different markings. This clone has some nice dark red markings.All in all, this is an average set. If you don't like the walker, scrap it for parts to use later and use the clone in your clone army. For $10, this is a nice and cheap way to army build. And since it's only $10, you don't have to worry about a money issue. Should you get it? I say that you at least get one.",building toys

"My parents bought this pool for a big summer party they had, and a ton of kids used it (I'd estimate 20 kids, mostly under 7 years, in and out of it all day). Then I took it home and set up for my daughter's 5th birthday, which saw 8 kids jumping, swimming and spalshing in it. And we've used it daily since then (all summer). It did have a small pin-hole after the first use that probably happened in moving it to our house (in the back of the truck), but was easily patched with clear Liquid Nails. We haven't had any trouble with deflating, collapsing, leaking, etc. since then.It is a pain to drain the water because the weight of the full pool keeps water from getting out of the small drain hole on the bottom (we've tried on the grass and on the driveway - even overnight the thing is still full). I have to let the air out of the top 2 rings to get the water out. But we bought a large bicyle-type pump (in the pool section of ToysRUs) which works ok - air compressor would be better.It does get dirty - particularly with our hard water. So even with a cover and chlorine I have to dump the water every few days. It would be nice to have a filter, but then again - it's only a $30 pool. I give the kids a butterfly net and have them get the grass out when they are playing in the pool.The kids absolutely love it (I have 3 obnoxious little monsters, 3, 5 & 7 years) and they give it a pretty strenuous workout every day. It's held up well and will hopefully still be useable for next year. On the REALLY hot days, I even get in with them, and I can see why they love it. They can really swim in it, rather than ""wade"" like they did in the little plastic one.It won't compare to the easy-set type pools with filters etc., but it's a great kiddie-pool.

"This is the second spray commander I have purchased. The first one worked wonderfully but unfortunately my dog got into the pool with it on and ruined it. Because it was so effective I decided to purchase another one.I adopted my dog when he was a year old. He had some bad habits which resulted in unnecessary annoying barking or not listening to me when I would call him. If the neighbor's dog came up the the fence, he would go crazy barking and growling at him and the only way I could make him stop was to go over and physically pull him away. Also I could not let him roam freely in our unfenced yard at our vacation home because he would not respect boundaries.I purchased this collar to hopefully remedy these issues. It worked wonders. After only a few times of being sprayed when he was doing something bad (such as walking away from me when I called him, acting like a fool at the fence when the neighbor's dog was there, or getting into something he shouldn't) his behavior improved dramatically. I now trust him completely off leash no matter where we are. He responds much better to my commands and while he still barks, it is much easier to control, and is at more 'appropriate' times. He absolutely HATES the spray, even though it doesn't hurt him, therefore it creates a sufficient distraction which in turn forces him to pay attention to me.I would recommend this to anyone as an effective training tool for correcting undesirable behaviors.

But due to the high sugar content they are not weight loss products as the name of the product and company advertising suggests. The Optima line of Slimfast products reduces, but does not eliminate the volume of sugar. This is really stupid on the part of the Slimfast Company. They could have eliminated sugar all together and replaced it with Splenda. Then they would have actually had a weight loss product. But due to the low cost of sugar and the fact that most people prefer the taste of sugar, they chose to ""reduce"" the sugar content. The smart consumer will not buy this product, unless you have no need for weight loss, and don't mind buying a good tasting product from a company that misleads the public in their advertising.Since the main ingredient in all Slimfast products is sugar, their products have absolutely no weight-reducing characteristic.

"OK, this is going to be a tough one. O'My O Clitoral Stimulating Gel is a water-based (glycerin) gel that is designed to stimulate the clitoris by using menthol to produce a tingling sensation, and as such a heightened sensitivity. The idea is that you will apply it in drips, until you reach the desired level of tingle.My first problem with this stuff is that it works best for solo play. Your lover will be hard-pressed to know how much to apply unless you talk him through it, which is somewhat less than sensuous. My second problem is that if you use too much of this stuff, it will produce an unpleasant burning sensation, rather than an erotic tingling one, and when used by a couple, that's too likely.Some women seem to swear by this stuff, whereas others swear *at* it. Similarly some men have complained about burning, whereas others have never felt any such thing. This suggests that results will be somewhat individualistic. So, you'll need to buy some to experiment with, and it's not cheap. On the up side, the fact that it is water-based which means that it will not interfere with condoms.Overall, I was not impressed with this stuff. At first I found the sensation quite stimulating, but before too long it began to just burn. So, for me it didn't work, whereas for the next woman it will.

I bought this almost 2 weeks ago. it took a couple of days for the seeds to sprout but when they did it didnt take long for the grass to grow very tall. A couple of things i noticed though. First when the grass was tall enough my cat pulled out the seed pod and i found it on the ground. I dont know if i didnt push it down far enough so that it clipped but she did it a couple of times. Anyways i have pushed it down with the roots and it is holding. The next day i found a trail of red ants going for it. I guess wheat grass is just as appealing to bugs as it is to cats!. I cleaned the area with soap and moved the dish but im going to pay extra attention for bugs. The other thing is that you will be pulling out floating grass every now and then. All in all though my cat loves it which was the reason why i got it. Whenever i see her go by she munches on it and i think it should last hopefully another week. If the bugs find it again i might move it to the 2nd floor or just buy potted wheat grass. Not bad though and depending on how it ends up i might by it again.,cats

How stupid do you think I am?However, constant sneezing and irritation due to a dusty work environment eventually made me give in and try this thing out.It's absolutely amazing! The first few times are very strange. The feeling you get when using it for the first time is similar to snorting water up your nose while swimming (not very pleasent) and your nose will most likely run for a day or two afterwards, so keep some tissues on hand.If you use it on a regular basis though, you'll really be pleased with the results. I was sneezing at least 15 times a day and now I only sneeze 1-3 times and only at the end of the day after I've been inhaling dust at work for 9 hours. I no longer have to deal with a stuffed up nose and the constant nosebleeds I was getting from rubbing at it so much to ease the irritation.The one thing I have to warn you about with this item is NOT to use tap water. I tried using tap water at first and it felt like someone lit fire to my nose hairs. To remedy this, I bought some cheap distilled water and it worked like a charm. Also, please follow the instructions which say to use lukewarm water and breathe with your mouth. If you follow the simple instructions you'll become a neti pro in no time.So if you have allergies and you're tired of shoveling benadryl down your throat every day, I'd really give this a try.

The acrylic material is still holding up, but I am a lot more careful cleaning it than with glass. The only problem I've had with this unit is a rattling noise that seems to come from the hood. It can be quite for 10 minutes to a couple of days. Then it starts rattling. I adjust the hood and it goes away. Lately, in the last couple of weeks the pump has started with some serious rattling which I can't get rid of. It annoys me and I am sure the fish are even more annoyed.

It's also a bit larger than you'd might expect (the legs can probably grip your head like a hat) but it doesn't go overboard.If you are huge fan of tachikomas it's a must buy.

"When I became pregnant over 8 years ago, I developed CTS which is quite common. My OB-GYN told me that it would go away once I gave birth.Well, it didn't.I've been suffering from pain, pins/needles, and numbness for years. The ergonomic keyboard is a godsend, but activities that involve holding or grasping (eating, curling my hair, putting on make up) cause a great amount of discomfort.My chiropractor thought he could help me, and I also scheduled an appointment at my GP's. A gentlemen did both Nerve Conduction Studies and Electromyographies on me, and it was discovered that I had Carpal Tunnel Syndrome in my right hand. Surprisingly, a lot of my tingling and pain had to do with tendonitis and 'tennis elbow'! Fortunately, chiropractic massage and the TENS unit (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) have helped my condition *immensely*.It was recommended that I use a wrist stabilizer when I slept, regardless of the fact that the condition didn't wake me up at night.I tried several brands at the pharmacy, and the Futuro Deluxe was the BEST. I've been using it for several weeks now, and it's very easy to get on and off. I can definitely see a difference when I get up in the morning! One night, I forgot to put the stabilizer on, and I could feel a difference!I also use this produce when I'm relaxing around the house, such as when I'm watching TV or DVDs.There are three different velcroed areas to adjust for comfort, as well as a comfy padded area for below the fingers. Futuro Deluxe Wrist Stabilizer is designed for CTS, so if you suffer from this condition, this is the best product I've seen so far.Now, ordering this product online may be a bit tricky in terms of sizing. For example, my hands are quite small (some children have larger hands than I do!), and my forearms are small boned, too. However, when trying on the stabilizers at the pharmacy, I was VERY surprised to discover that the Large-X Large fit the best! I would have never guessed this sight unseen.",medical supplies equipment
"I love drinking dietary supplements, my body feels more refreshed and exhilarated the moment they go down. When I take vitamins they often upset my stomach and I can feel them dissolving slowly while churning my stomach acids making me feel nauseous. I discovered Ola Loa products while shopping at my local Whole Food on a rainy Saturday. The healthy looking oceanic packaging caught my eye and the list of minerals and elements raised my curiosity. The flavor is Tropical, and it tastes very strange, not the sort of tropical fruity taste one would imagine, but it does taste more like the picture on the box. To me it tastes like the ocean, slightly salty and fizzy! I don't mind the flavor at all since these make me feel so great after I drink them. Ola Loa has no sugars and artificial ingredients, I don't want to drink vitamins that are spiked with fake things so the taste doesn't bother me. I mix it really well with a small glass of cool water and the effervescent fizz feels really nice when drank right away.Few days ago I had an upset stomach due to something I ate, after taking Imodium, Rolaids and Alka Seltzer with mixed results, I took a packed of Ola Loa Orange powder, which has the same ingredients as the Tropical, and dissolved it. Relief surged upon me instantly, and my stomach woes went away. I felt relieved and happy that this did the trick, as I used to have a sensitive stomach in childhood, but I am not used to problems of any sorts now. The unpleasant feeling did not come back, I have doubt it was the Ola Loa powder that did the trick.This is a great way to take your daily vitamins and some other exotic things such as CQ10, Chromium, Iodide, Boron, and amino acids N- Acetyl cysteine, L-Arginine, L-Lysine, L-Glycine, TMG-Betaine, L-Glumine and herbs Bromelain and Pineapple Bioflavinoids.In the past I had great results taking drinkable vitamins and I now see this might be the way to go for the future. I recommend other flavors of Ola Loa such as the Orange which I enjoy as well. The packets can be comfortably taken on any traveling expediting as well as to the office and anywhere else my feet guide me that day. Recommended dose is 1-3 packets daily, but I find it that even one packet makes me feel great, and sometimes I don't bother to take more than that.- Kasia S.",nutrition wellness

"I just stopped a medium intensity dog-on-dog attack at the dog park with a can of Direct Stop. I hit the re-advancing dog twice (Austrailian Shepard who had just been thrown 10 feet from the other dog). Both times he ran away once sprayed. I had a can of powerful pepper spray in my other pocket but it wasn't needed. If I had sprayed the pepper spray it would have hammered 8 fellow dog park patrons and their dogs...not a good thing to do if you want to maintain good relations with your fellow dog owners at the park. Immediately afterwards two dog owners came up to me to ask what it was, and both put an order in with me for two cans each (I am a personal security trainer and reseller of related weapons).As a side note, Pepper Spray is very effective against highly aggressive dog breeds such as Pit-bulls. I had the unfortunate need to spray a Pit-bull attacking my cattle-dog a few months ago. The Pit immediately stopped it's attack and ran around the entire school yard rubbing it's face in the grass. I'd suggest dog owners who walk their dog's frequently, especially urban dwellers, to carry a can of each with them. Of course, the Pepper Spray does double duty as a great personal protection weapon against two legged animals as well! I highly suggest the Fox Labs ""Five Point Three"" formula (Cone spray), which is the hottest chemical weapon spray on the market (I personally self-test all chemical weapons before I recommend them, and Fox Labs is by far the most disabling I've ever hit myself with over the last 20 years!)Be Safe out there!",dogs

But in reality it does not really save any time and, after a month of rolling it, my wife and I ended up removing the screen and just scooping it like any other litter box. The reviews that mention that it leaks when you roll it are correct, though some litters that have less dust are not as bad. The review that states that it creates another mess by coating the inside walls with litter dust is correct also. For the product to work well, it needed to have been made of a more rigid plastic with a gasket to seal the dust in where the top and bottom connect. But even if it worked as advertised as seemingly ""hundreds"" of reviews would have you believe, you still have a drawer of messy litter to dispose of which means you just have one BIG scoop instead of several smaller ones, you periodically have to take it apart and scoop the litter that sticks inside, and because of the rolling, you have to take the whole thing apart and clean it as well.",cats

"This is a great toy for young children just learning how to scoot around or crawl. It's extremely easy to activate. When you touch the monkey (doesn't matter where) it will make a monkey sound and then move. As it moves, a cute little melody plays that helps the kids track which direction it's going. It moves a short distance, turns, and gives the little monkey sound again. You might think with all the noises that it would get irritating but it has a volume control!!!! Yay!The monkey never goes too far away so that kids can't get to him (usually 1-3 of my son's crawling motions--I guess they aren't steps). The monkey keeps my son active but in a limited space because of all the turns it does.We have hardwood floors with a room size rug on it. The monkey moves great on both. He can run into furniture and walls and doesn't tip over too often. The tipping over is the only issue we have encountered but that's usually because my son has picked up the monkey by it's arm and hasn't placed him down properly.I've said that the toy is great for barely mobile kids. The reason is that my son has now mastered the art of crawling and is more interested in checking out all the things we've forgotten/haven't baby-proofed than playing with any of his toys.

And the dogs smell good enough to eat (if you like coconut). Not overly perfumy, but definitely makes them NOT smell like a typical ""wet dog""...!I use this product in conjunction with Micro-Tek shampoo - and all of my dogs have a good result from this shampoo/conditioner combination. The Eqyss products work on my oily coats, soft coats, sensitive coats, and ones with pyodermas, contact allergies and many other ""issues"" equally and give them all a beautiful soft coat free of tangles and free of hot spots or dry skin.Mega-Tek comes in 16oz and a smaller size perfect for trying out. When diluted as described above, my 16oz bottle did approximately 60 baths for a 15lb dog... Less if you have trouble spots... But still quite the value!",cats
"Like some of the other reviewers, I was disappointed in these. Yes they are a healthier option than traditional krispie treats, which is why they still rate a three.

"Having never owned an indoor cat before, I found the only thing I disliked about cat ownership was the litterbox--scooping a foul litterbox, sweeping loose litter off the floor, litter dust all over everything, etc. I didn't have a hundred smackers or more to blow on a self-cleaning litterbox, so when I heard about the Omega-Paw and did some research, I felt I was onto something great. Once I received the litterbox, I found out my feeling was right on.I had read some confusing reviews that suggested rubbing oil on the inside, taping and bolting pieces together, etc., but none of that is really necessary. Really, why make something so wonderfully simple into something complicated? The clips keep it closed well and, unless you have a cat with bowel problems or don't like to clean your box daily, it stays quite clean on the inner sides. I have a large Maine Coon kitten who loves to excavate his litter, and he kicked litter from his old box to Kingdom Come. The Omega Paw contains all the litter and dust quite well, and the regular size is plenty big enough to accomodate him. It's truly easy to use, I just roll it over and back again, give it a little tip, and viola! No more scooping!! YAY!! It even saves on litter, somehow.I really can't say enough nice things about this litterbox. It truly deserves 5 stars. Now, all I need is the mat to keep him from tracking....",cats
"I must say I was very skeptical when I received this massager as a gift. It looked a little clunky and is pretty heavy. However, once I turned it on and gave it a try I was pleasantly suprised.It has a really nice vibration speed and motion that is a little different compared to most massagers. Also, the rythm really is relaxing for the whole body, not just the area you have the massager directly on.I would recommend this product but wish they made it a little lighter. The wieght of it is a little cumbersome and could be a little too much for smaller individuals.",health care
"I still have not gotten it to work. The motor works, but I can't get suction into the inlet tube. The basket that holds the carbon media is very poorly designed; it opens easily, spilling the charcoal out into the canister (where it doesn't belong). I did solve that by using 2 rubber bands to hold it in place. There is also a ""rigid core"" that fits inside the basket; my wife accidently threw it out after the basket opened when she had to clean it (I can see how it would happen). I reordered a replacement, and it was several WEEKS before it shipped. Overall, I have not had a very good experience with this filter, although if I could get the $@#% thing to work, I might form a different opinion.",fish aquatic pets

A set of Duracell alkalines lasted a little longer than these and a set of ultra batteries lasted about 10 days. I guess that this is because the monitor is a low-drain device and batteries seem to behave differently when used in a low-drain or a high-drain device like flash or digital camera.Anyway, rechargable are always a better choice, I am starting to save money already.",household supplies

After just a couple days of having them on, and the nail beginning to grow, my cat managed to catch his nail in the lace edging of my rather expensive bedding.

It has different heads that you can use on different parts of the back, and part of the handle adjusts to the motion (kind of like in some tooth brushes). He loves it and the heat is also a nice feature.The reason why I gave it 3 starts, it's because of the vibration given out by the massager, my hand gets a funny sensation, it's not too pleasant. The same applies if you're massaging yourself. So my recommendation have someone do it for you, so you can relax and enjoy.So in general for the price of 16 bucks it's a good product to have.",health care
"My stepmom bought a set of these for each of my three kids ages 12, 9, and 6. All I have to say is do not buy these!!!! My six year old did great on the first page but as the other reviewer said the film gets all over the markers. we even tried washing them off and it did no good. Also when my 6 year old was coloring he would rest his arm on the bottom of the page and when he would pick it up it would be covered in black. Bottom line about 30 minutes after they got them my kids arms and faces were COVERED in black smudges as were my hands somewhat just from holding their pictures to look at them. MESSY MESSY MESSY. My 12 year old finally just went and stuck one of the papers under running water and washed off all the black to see the neon underneath and this proved to be the least messy but least rewarding way to do it.

You must preheat the oven for 20 minutes before placing the ovenware in it, and the ovenware pan must be on a cookie sheet in the center of the over.

Quaker Instant Oatmeal packets are the perfect solution, for those with little time to cook breakfast, or those who don't want to deal with a messy saucepan afterwards.I don't have a microwave oven, but you don't need one for this product. Just put the contents of a packet (I like 2 packets!) in a bowl, and pour enough boiling water for the oatmeal to reach the consistency you like (the instructions say ""up to cup"" of water per packet).

Quaker Instant Oatmeal can also be made in a microwave oven of course, and you can use milk instead of water.The Maple and Brown Sugar flavor is my favorite, but there are many others to chose from. At 160 calories a packet for the Maple and Brown Sugar, the low fat content makes it a good choice for dieters, as it is a breakfast that is nourishing and ""sticks to the ribs"" as my Mom was fond of saying (the fat content is listed as 2 grams per serving, with 0% on the saturated and trans fats).

Based on the recommendation of friends, we decided to give the ""Kong"" a try - and it's awesome!""Kongs"" are made to be extremely strong, so they don't fall apart when the little ones chew on them for hours (or even when our big guy decides to have a little chewing action on it himself). We've found that our dogs love them as is, but they REALLY get into it when we insert a treat or some of the ""Kong"" vitamin-enriched tasty paste into the open cavity. They'll spend lots of time and energy attempting to get the treat out (which is unlikely) &/or enjoying the ""tasty paste"".Overall, we found this to be a great toy for our ""little ones"" - it provides them with something that they're allowed to chew & that I as a ""puppy parent"" don't have to worry about falling apart due to long bouts of gnawing. Our dogs give the ""Kong"" a ""2 paws up""!!!",dogs
"My eight-year-old daughter and I have played with Magnetix for a couple of years now. She pulled them out again a two nights ago, and we made a some fun things.Today was the big shopping day after Thanksgiving. I picked up a couple of 100-piece tubes of Magnetix parts on sale. We just got done playing with them for two hours. I must say, it was fun.I understand the risk of ingesting the magnets. Our daughter is old enough that she can open child-proof bottles, so there are literally hundreds of items in this household which can harm her. I am not concerned about this toy.

I recently used two of these bags to transport cats cross country on JetBlue. No one batted an eye at the size of the bag and most didn't even notice we had animals with us. They fit under the seat with only a little squeezing in the height dimension. They were plenty sturdy in most respects but one of the cats scratched through the mesh used for the windows. The cat could easily have increased the size of the hole and caused problems so I ended up having to lean over and pet her frequently to keep her agitated digging at the bag to a minimum. Overall the bags worked for us but I was disappointed in how easily the cats were able to damage them. Maybe they work better with dogs or people with a loooooong time to train the cats to get used to the bags. We didn't have zipper problems but our vet suggested using paper clips to clip the zipper pulls together so the cats couldn't work their way out.,cats

After some difficulty in understanding how to get the timer working, the directions are poor and the the buttons on the timer are not correctly marked, I got it working.All went well until on the second day of operation. I went downstairs to check on the feeder and the cat. Low and behold the cat had inserted his paw into the feeder spout and was shaking out cat food pellets. He would eat them and then repeat the operation. I then put my finger into the feeder spout and was able to shake the feeding device and get out cat food pellets.Needless to say this was not what I was lead to believe in the product advertising. Failure to make the feeder cat proof is a major design flaw. My cat is no Albert Einstein, so this will be a problem for others.",cats

I hired a professional contractor to install it and it took him less than two hours (he removed the back door to install the dog door into it, and then replaced the back door on its hinges.)

I think we could have gone another week on the tray but we changed it anyways just to be on the safe side.My cat had little trouble getting used to the new system and now eagerly watches it scoop her waste away. I would highly recommed this to any cat owner as the actual cost isn't really that much more than traditional litter and its a whole lot less work. I do recommend getting the extra canopy top for the unit and the large econ-o pack of litter trays.Again overall, excellent product that works as advertised.

"Sahale snacks were a pleasant surprise. They're not over-sweet nor over-hot, and they've got a lot of flavor and texture. Over all I'd say they're among the best snacks you can buy, not only in terms of taste and freshness but because they're far healthier than a lot of the stuff you find on the grocery shelves. However the price is pretty high for the amount you get. Even at the substantially reduced price of the variety pack, it's a little high. However, for the occasional treat, it's well worth the price.

The speaker is on the bottom so it isn't too bad when it in on the carpet, but when it is on a hard surface it can be quite loud.

Other than laugh, he doesn't do anything other than stand there. Even when he's active, you're just standing there watching and it's the same deal over and over and over. It's not so funny anymore after the first few times. You can't make him sit or cuddle with him. He's not a stuffed animal at all. Honestly, she was more impressed with the little box that makes the giggle sound when you open the flap. The one that comes with the box and says to discard as it is not part of the toy. She likes to hide it places and then push the button.If you want this for your child and money is no object, I say go for it. I'd be willing to bet your child will lose interest after a day or two.

"I give it 2 stars instead of one because when it does work, it works great. It shut that dog up better than a newspaper. However, it only works for about 6 hours and the battery is dead. A replacement battery costs $5.00. I contacted the manufacturer and asked could I upgrade to the rechargeable model. For some odd reason, I was not allowed to. They said they could only replace the one I had with another just like it. I took it, thinking maybe something was wrong with the one I had. I received the other one and had the same problem. I called the manufacturer again and after considerable consultation behind the curtain, they agreed to the upgrade for another $50.00. I have had the rechargeable one and it works ok but needs recharging within a couple or three hours. Also, it seems not to pack the punch that the battery unit did. With the battery unit, all you had to do was show it to the dog and it would go quiet. Though I have looked no further, I'm sure there are more efficient products out there. I've already spent $100 so I can't afford further experimentation, unless it's with a bullet.",dogs

"This fountain does exactly what it says it will. I ordered the Drinkwell fountain at the same time as the Petmate fountain. I foster cats/kittens and wanted to see if either was better. I believe they are comparable. The Petmate one has removable backup reservoir (hold more slightly more water), where the Drinkwell has a built-in area that holds a bit of extra water (easier to clean). The Drinkwell creates the water flowing sound, where the Petmate is virtually silent. Cats preferences are individual, some like the sound, some don't. I'm happy with the fountain.",cats

I'd seen less expensive models in various catalogs, but after having exposure to one probably made by Invacare, nothing else seemed to meet the standard I'd set in my mind.While I would have preferred the more deluxe model with a padded seat, and backrest, this one fit my budget. It's the first time I've seen one with such an easy-to-take price tag, and I jumped on it.While I will cover this in my comment regarding the seller, I want to say that I ordered the rollator at about 6:00AM, on 1/11/07, and it was here in my home on 1/12/07. THAT is service!Unpacking it was a little difficult for me alone, due to my disability, and the weight of the rollator.

Ashlee loves to give Elmo his drink and then make him sit on the potty. I feel she may still be a little to young to understand that's what she is suppose to do also.

Knowing the ""spider man"" type toys were more ""manly"" we bought this one for him for christmas instead. What we got was something that costs the same as an elmo doll but nowhere near the use. First off the moving arms don't reset themselves (this is something the manufacturer even knows as they slip extra instructions in on how to manually reset them) so when he's done he looks like his arms are broke cause they point backwards. There are only 2 songs he sings and they're very short just lasting less than a minute. Other than swinging arms there is no other movement. And not to mention the worst part yet- the singing is done by what sounds like a 5 year old kid which sounds really weird looking at Spider man.

Much better results than benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid products alone have had. We have found that she can skip one day, but if 2 days are missed, breakouts reoccur.

"After knee surgery, a family member was in a brace for many weeks and could not bend his leg. His home-care therapists recommended this chair, which is available from many different sources. He decided to get this model, based on its apparent popularity, and the descriptions here and elsewhere.Without other chairs to compare to, we don't know if they are all designed for such easy assembly AND disassembly, but we are pleased that this one can indeed be taken apart easily for storage or travel. It comes ""knocked down"" for efficient shipping in a reasonable-sized box, and you have to put it together, as with most such products. Well, in our case, the chair was assembled by our first-grade child, without really even reading the instruction sheet! Yep, that's as easy as it gets.The result was a very sturdy chair that has enough weight to remain stable in the tub, while not being too heavy to carry or move around. The seat has lots of room, there are ""handhold"" spaces on each side of the seat, and a hole in the seat back where one could hold on (for balance only). There is a small hole on each side of the seat front, giving you two choices of places to store a handheld shower nozzle while lathering up or shampooing.It's a perfectly fine product, and the only reasons not to give it five stars are fairly minor. For one, the front of the seat is more or less straight. Although rounded, it is not a ""waterfall"" front, and some people with leg injuries might not find it as comfortable. (Our user here has to keep his leg level and straight ahead, which means he does not put the weight of his leg against that seat edge. That might be an issue for some people, depending on the injury.) Again, in our case it was perfectly comfortable, and as we discovered, it is WELL worthwhile to get the version with the seat back.We saw an extraordinary range of prices for this item. If you are part of a healthcare system with access to a good supplier of medical equipment, you might be able to get it locally at a good price and free delivery. But in other places, without price competition, you might as well go online. Amazon's price is a little high (at $58), but if you include the price of free shipping, that's not too bad a deal, depending where you live.",medical supplies equipment

If I slept on my back I think it would be a little bit better, but I could never see myself using this on a regular basis.Also of note, the fact that this is only sold in standard size a bit disappointing.I thought that this could finally be the pillow to take the place of my old (and falling apart) foam rubber pillow that I've been using for 20 years...but it seems that my search will continue.

"I care for an elderly parent in home, and needed something to alert me in case they fell or needed assistance while in another part of the house. I had hoped this device would be the solution. My plan was to program it to call my cell phone if my parent ever pressed the pendant alert button.There were a number of problems from the start. First, the unit was difficult to program. It took several steps -- switching power on and off, speakers on and off, and so forth -- and it balked when I tried to enter the forwarding number. The touch tones just wouldn't register in the base unit. It took several attempts to get the number entered.Second there were two buttons on the pendant -- one for alert, one to cancel the alert. I would prefer only one button on an alert pendant, so the feeble or elderly won't be needlessly confused or accidentally press the wrong button and think help is coming when it isn't, or accidentally cancel a help call before it is made.Third the pendant range was very short. It wasn't comforting to think the person wearing it could easily get out of range and the alert button be useless. I found it only worked reliably when the pendant was in the same room as the base unit.Fourth is the ""off hook"" behavior of the system. It would be easier if the unit would simply pick up and play a few beeps and the alert message over the phone if someone happens to be using the extension. Instead, the unit tries to make the calls anyway. You get alerted, yes, with a bunch of attempted calls and touch tone sounds, but I think it could have been done better.I just didn't find it trustworthy enough to use. I sent it back, and opted instead for a low-tech (and much cheaper) simple pendant alarm that's activated by a pull on a string. The only downside to it -- which is true of the Telemergency 700C too -- is that it isn't waterproof and can't be worn or used in the shower. But that's what we're going with until someone comes up with a more reliable and trustworthy and well thought out product.Update",medical supplies equipment

"Purchase this as an extra set after receiving Sony charger. The lesson came very soon. I had to rush to a nearby 7/11 minutes before an event. The Olympus DSC showed ""low bat"" on the 2700maH batteries (came with the charger) after few shots and didn't even like the 2500maH spares that were charged 2 to 3 days prior.I have done some research and weekly experiments. I refreshed and re-charged repeatedly and measures in-between. The voltage dropped from the ~1.4V to ~1.2V within 3 days on all 8 of them. One tech paper stated that NiMH batteries do lose 1% of their charges in 24 hours at room temp when not in use. The Sony ones must have far exceeded the typcial case. It's winter time in Calfornia and the moisture doesn't come into play.I read all the reviews before the purchases.

"My 2 year old daughter received this product as a birthday gift on Saturday and during the party while she was playing with the mickey, he just quit working. We changed the batteries, and put him up for the rest of the party. After everyone went home, we let her play with it again. He worked for about five minutes and then quit working again. After we changed the batteries again, and he still wasn't working, we let him sit for the last few days. Now it is Monday night, and he still doesn't work. The batteries are from a brand new package, so I know it is not the batteries. We are very dissapointed with this product. Then when I tried to call the number they give in the instruction booklet, it redirects me to a long distance directory assistance number and tells me it will cost $5.50 or something to make the call. Forget it! I am taking it back and getting something else for her. Too bad. I was very excited about all the features. It seemed like a great concept. It must have been overheating with just 15 minutes of use. The battery case did seem warm when we changed the batteries.

"I first saw this toy online, and thought it was a must have for our daughter since she's really getting into puzzles and stacking and things of that sort.The idea is wonderful - three stackers in one, with varying levels of difficulty. The first two are quite simple, and the third requires a bit more skill and mental energy to piece back together correctly.So, we bought this for our daughter's first birthday, and it was a hit! Even her noise-making over-stimulating toys were forgotten when she opened this one.Why only three stars? Well, a couple of things:First the paint stuck together between the pieces - most significantly on the more difficult stack of the three, and it was quite hard to seperate the pieces. When we finally did seperate them, much of the paint was removed and transfered to the other pieces, and more of the paint chipped off soon after with very little play. Even non-toxic paint I'd prefer she didn't swallow in these quantities. I would have thought this was exclusive to our toy, but a few other reviewers said the same thing.Second - odd as it may sound - the three prongs sticking up worried me a bit in terms of her falling on them. Since the base is broad, it doesn't overturn as easily as the single stacker. Since she is learning to walk, she does tumble over a good bit. Maybe a needless concern, but worth mentioning.Ultimately we returned this to the toy store and replaced it with the simple rainbow stacker. I think she's gotten an equal amount of play out of it - and it doesn't seem to carry the problems and hazards of the geometric one.This one simply needs improvement in construction (let the paint dry before assembling the toy!) and safety (maybe seperate the three parts rather than putting them all on the same base)before I would think of purchasing it again.",learning education
"This is not only the ideal scope for beginners but enough of an instrument to show you new things in the sky for years to come. It is sturdy and simple to operate. It has enough light-gathering power (more important than magnification) to reveal dim star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies and good enough optics to show you the surface of planets like Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars.Dobsonians like this one give by far the most view for the dollar, and the price on this one is great. Affordable as this scope is, there is no reason to give so much as a glance at the numerous trashy 60mm refractors with exaggerated magnification claims that litter the market.Some advice on selection. Dobsonians come in a range of sizes. A 114mm (4 "") is a bit on the small side but still a fine instrument, especially if your ability to carry large objects is limited. A 150-200mm (6-8"") scope like this one is right in the middle of the recommended range. A 250mm (10"") is on the big side, and you should buy one only if you are able-bodied.A very useful bonus is a full-sized 9x50mm finder scope. If competing models offer only a 6x30mm finder, you should factor in the cost of upgrading to the far better 50mm size.You will need eyepieces.

"The Blue light is the only thing that has helped me have a normal life for the last two years. I used the bright lites starting in 1996 and they helped a bit but nothing like this device.I went to the sites described by some reviewers here. These sites do expound that this blue light may affect AMD. This includes the bright lights and also the sun - it is not limited to this device. To get the same therapeutic affect with the bright lights and the sun I would need several hours more a day so the total blue light would be the same. I read Rosenthal's new book and I do not believe he checked into the lights much as he dismisses them off-hand.I have no choice but to use the blue light. Before I bought mine I suffered suicidal depression, an inability to have coherent speech, and a affect on my body where the slightest effort was not worth it. The bright lights diminished this affect but the blue light eliminated it, except for a bit of lethargy in the dark winters.There are many medications out there that cause complications if the user is not carefull and maybe the blue light is one of them. Even the medication alternatives to light therapy cause problems. I can not go back to the way I felt prior to this product and will not.

I tried several store brands but none of them were as thick and durable as Hefty. In my opinion Hefty is the brand to buy. The 33 gallon capacity makes these garbage bags great for both families and single people.The bags are economical, too. At the Amazon price they cost roughly 35 cents each and that's a good deal especially because a bag can usually handle two days' worth of garbage.Highly recommended.",household supplies

Much better than a DUI!I have two suggestions for getting an accurate reading:1. Do not take a deep breath before blowing into the breathalyzer. All that extra air will dilute the alcohol vapor that goes into the analyzer.2. When blowing into the breathalyzer, try your best to capture the end of your breath. That will give you a much more accurate reading. Think about it . . . it makes sense . . . you would want to measure the alcohol deep in your lungs to get the best results. I've tried it using the first part of my breath one day and got a reading of .056, a minute later, using the ""deep lung"" air, the reading was .078.

"My daughter bought this massager for me for Christmas and I know she spent a lot of money, even with the 20% off at Linens and Things. That is why I hesitate to tell her that it stopped working.

You feel like you're falling off or just sitting on the edge. I had to move it to the couch because my son and husband kept complaining they can't sit back in the seat. The remote kept falling out of its pocket which may have contributed to it acting up and eventually stopped working altogether. First it was not doing the choices you pressed, then not shutting off when I pressed off (I had to unplug it). I don't know what the blue light is all about. It just shows us now that it's getting power, so we assume the remote is not working. My son, who loves taking things apart and fixing them was not able to fix it.

A simple twist of the heavy chrome-plated disk that you set on top of a concave mirror (furnished) starts it spinning at an increasing rate for at least two minutes.

Ideally this ridge would be even twice as wide. The scooper I received does have a narrow solid part but on a slope, not the lowest part of the pan... so, it is of no use whatsoever to sift out the small solid parts (the most difficult to get out).

So while I thought I was getting off easy with the cleaning- I actually was creating a HUGE cleaning headache for myself...the grill inside was a nightmare to clean! (Even if your cat does not spray remember not to roll the box until after the clumping litter has hardened otherwise you will get sticky litter stuck to the grill.)

"We love the Omega Paw litter boxes to death, but when we got our first two we ordered these so we could have cute little matching sets and looking back we really should have spent that money to get a third box.Our cats don't like the paw cleaning side, they refused to walk on it. So we turned them over to at least collect some of the cat litter, but it still got everywhere so we ended up putting newspapers under the opening for each box and that keeps most of it off the floor. We leave the mats we have in place for cute value and because sometimes you can get away with just emptying those, but our new boxes are doing fine without them. The cats even seem to like to pee on the mat once in a while out of spite and then the cat litter melts and cements into the little groves. You might have better luck if you have less cats who are tidier and have less sensitive paws, but don't buy more than one until you know for sure they can tolerate it.",cats

"I tend to slouch quite badly, and was just looking a quick, inexpensive fix to that problem. This solved it.I will say, as a preamble, if you tend hunch over as well, this product probably won't help as much as others - it obviously only focuses on shoulders). I began wearing this in the winter, so I wore a thin vest, then the brace, then a t-shirt and I didn't get the sore armpits many people complained about - EXCEPT for one day when I accidently wore the thing upside down. If you look carefully at the product, you'll realize there is a right side up, and a wrong side up, though it is NOT clearly marked. Wearing it the wrong way round makes it sit quite high, and then it does hurt to wear. Overall, in terms of interaction with clothes, it's a bit thicker and wider than a bra-strap, and sits in the same general area so figure out how that would work with your clothing style. The first several days I did get sore shoulders, but that passed- I really do believe that it is more a case of my using muscles to sit upright that I didn't use before, rather the brace. As one reviewer mentioned, you are constantly aware of the brace being there - if you weren't, then you're probably sitting slouched over.",medical supplies equipment

I have three cats who all have the feline herpes virus, and I used to use another product and would just put it on their feet and they lick it off, but the manufacturer changed that formulation so I tried Viralys gel. Like I said, if they made it thicker, I could easily slather it on my cats and dispense it to them that way. It's good that this gel is transparent--that way it doesn't stain the carpet if they shake it off. I put a quarter-sized dab on their hindquarters and then they lick it. I recently purchased the L-Lysine powder, for humans (it's a quarter the price of the pet variety) and sprinkle it on their wet food. The downside of using this is that now the cats don't like dry food, and I hate wet food--it's smelly, messy and gives them bad breath. Well, they have to have Lysine somehow so sacrifices have to be made. Again, this gel is pretty good, but too expensive if you have more than one cat and they need to be dosed twice a day.",cats

I have a couple who prefer the ones made at a 45 degree angle, though. Some won't use this at all, and prefer to sharpen their claws upright, so they'll need a different scratcher.But for someone just starting off with a small kitten, it's perfect. By the time the kitten is too big to use it, it will be time to replace it anyway. I had to throw mine out before it was all scratched up, though.

There's a small magnet on the tip, but the magnet isn't very strong. Won't pick up a glass or soda can because the jaws aren't wide enough, but that hasn't been an issue for her. There are other types of extenders you can buy, if you need this capability.- Dressing Aid - She keeps this upstairs for use in the bed and bath and uses it like another reach extender to pick up clothes and towels. Can also be used to put on slippers more easily than the shoe horn.- Sock Aid - ingenious device that really works. It's a bit stiff which requires some effort to get a sock on it, but probably will loosen with use. Even works with nylon hosiery.- Shoe horn and long handled sponge - nothing fancy, but they do the job.I spent the first 5 days at home helping her out, but after that, this kit along with an elevated toilet seat are the only items she needed to take care of herself and allowed me to return back to work.Bonus tip",medical supplies equipment

It isn't that I don't ever get hungry its just that when I do sit down to eat, the amount I feel full after eating is cut about in half. Then I don't feel the need to eat until the next meal. It helps kill snacking and overeating for me, which makes it great in conjunction with any type of modified eating program that you are trying to stick to. It does not make me feel jittery or weird. The biggest issue is just remember to take the pills 3 times a day and it does tend to work a little better if you can take it about an hour before each meal.

Also, when first using, it is best to test your scanner when there is no fever. I find that 98.6 is not always a consistent baseline. Learn each person's base temp before the fever begins.IMPORTANT - if the patient has a hot forehead due to sunburn and you suspect a fever developing, use another non-forehead means to double check.

Apply some aloe vera, wait, and then check when the skin has had a chance to recover a bit. Double check with alternate thermometer.Of course, I also find that the ""lip test"" is great too. An old pro taught it to me. If you touch your lips to your child's forehead, you can easily tell if the heat you felt with your hand is fever or just a warm body. I can almost as accurately predict the temperature with the lip test, but always use my Exergen forehead scan to confirm. :)",health care

Plus their fingers are not getting any smaller. Now the wagon is going back to Radio Flyer. The company offered to pick it up for a full refund.Radio Flyer is so far treating this is as isolated case. The company will not currently recall wagons with canopy holes. My issue was still suppose to be escalated throughout Radio Flyer's executive management. So there might be future design changes, but not now. I cannot imagine this issue being an isolated problem.The canopy is nice to use on really sunny days, but not all the time. Nothing else could be used to plug the (4) holes since that may pose a choking hazard. We're very bummed about giving up the wagon, but it makes sense for safety reasons.",sports outdoor play

"We got this feeder for one of our very sensitive stomach/ gobbler cats and it has been great since I've figured out a few things-1)sounds like the feeder has been modified so that the cat can't stick it's paw and self feed which is exactly what it needed. We duct-taped a cut off half of a soda bottle so that the food comes out of the little end and the cat can at best get a few toes up there- not pretty but it works.2)when we switched to a higher calorie dense food, the feeder did not work as the food was too heavy. It works fine if we don't fill up the feeder past about halfway. I thought that I would need to mess with it more, but really it's been about a month and I haven't needed to refill it.This cat was also a whiner and scream at us and hang onto our pantlegs whenever we went to the kitchen, and now she is much better behaved and doesn't try to beat up the other cats when they are eating their food.

"I am a former teaching fellow in Physiology and I also have additional graduate education in both biochemistry and psychology. Some of my studies included neurobiology and I have a lot of meditation experience. As part of my work, I teach meditation workshops and also use biofeedback personally and for education purposes. While I know the basics of neurofeedback, it is not a specialty area. So, using this product was a brand new experience for me. This is not biofeedback as such, but it could be coupled with biofeedback for various purposes.What this equipment does in generate patterns of light that are synchronized with sound. There are also various CDs available that couple the Proteus unit to music. I tried the system in both ways, but got the most out of coupling it with music.The glasses provided with the Proteues are meant to be used while your eyes are closed. They generate very bright light that shines through your eyelids. In EEG work, a light strobe is used in a similar fashion to induce seizures in susceptible people or for other types of study.The theoretical concept behind this type of technology is that one can induce certain brain states characterized by different amplitudes of specific types of brain waves i.e. alpha, beta, theta and delta. Different patterns of brain waves result in different mind states. The product literature also talks about the concept of entrainment where your brain waves synchronize to the light and sound while your brain hemispheres are synchronized or balanced.While I can't speak to the validity of the theory, testing, etc., I could talk about my experience. In short, it was awesome and it certainly seemed to have the ability to induce different states of consciousness including relaxation and euphoria. Because I do biofeedback work, I was curious to couple it with heart rate variability (HRV) and pulse data. In my case, I seemed to reach higher levels of brain/heart coherence. This correlates with being in a relaxed, open and healthy state. That's all you really need to know if the technical language is unfamiliar.As an aesthetic experience, using this unit was simply AWESOME! When I bought it, my expectations weren't that high. However, all of my expectations were exceeded. Because you are wearing glasses that generate the light, it completely fills your visual field. The effect is indescribable. Also, the pulsations of light induce states that are unusual and very pleasant. I found the experience fascinating and I can certainly see how this could be useful for meditation, relaxation and perhaps even pain management. I was having back pain the day I used it and I definitely had less pain afterwards. My feeling of well-being also remained after my session was over.I am a bit surprised that this device is marketed to the general public because there is the possibility that it could induce seizures in some people. The literature and the product description provide warnings that people prone to seizures and on psychotropic medications should NOT use it without consulting with their physicians.I'm guessing that the type of people who are looking at this product are probably interested in meditation, self development and our expansion of consciousness.

If I knew how long they would last, there is a good chance that I would give them five (5) stars. So far, they have gone through ten washings and still look new. Most likely, I will be placing another order as my other diapers continue to wear out. For those wishing to contact KCK Medical, here is their web",health care

"We purchased these letters along with the lowercase and the numbers for my 4 year old daughter. Not only does she and her little brother love playing with them, she is also learning with them. We pick a different theme every week, like one week we wanted her to learn her phone number, birthday and where she lived. So we spelled that out on the board, (we bought a large magnetic/dry erase board and hung it in the living room) and every time we walked by it or saw it, we would stop and talk about it and quiz her. Now she knows her birthday, her phone number and the city and state she lives in. It only took her a couple days. We plan on doing this with reading and sight words too. It also helped her to learn to spell her full name too. The letters are a good size (not like the small ones you get at Walmart) and there are more than one of a lot of them, so you can actually spell more than one word. We are planning to probably get another set so we can spell out sentences for her to work with eventually! Would definitely recommend!",learning education

When I found out they also make biscotti, I ordered them right away. No local stores carry these,and I have no idea why, thank goodness for Amazon!I am picky about wheat alternatives but I really like these. They are not exactly the same as the wheat version, but they are very close. I tried the Almond Anise flavor and they taste really good. The texture is a bit grainy and they are more dense than wheat biscotti, so you can really dunk them with out fear of them crumbling.I was worried about the quantity, but since they are individually wrapped, and so good we had no problem!Pamela's makes the best wheat alternatives bar none! If you haven't tried them I cannot recommend them strongly enough! You have GOT to try the organic peanut butter chocolate chip cookie. They are soooo good!

The first one became inoperative after an accident no scale could be expected to survive (think water, and lots of it).I had the original for over two years and never once had to change the battery despite using it twice a day. The scale is very accurate to .2 pounds. If one gets off the scale and steps right back on, it will have the exact same weight reading each time. I cannot speak to the accuracy of the body fat analysis as I've never had it measured any other way. That being said, it is very useful in tracking long term trends. For instance, I recently started doing a little weight lifting with my aerobic work, and while my weight has dropped only slightly (a couple pounds), my body fat percentage has dropped about 4 percentage points.The scale is very easy to use and the LCD output is, in my opinion, very easy to read.The new scale, which I just received, seems to be an improved version of the SC-560. It now measures lean muscle mass and bone mass in addition to weight and body fat. It also produces weight and analysis results faster than the older version.All in all, an excellent scale for those who want to measure long term trends of their body composition, or those who simply want fast results with accuracy to a fifth of a pound.

I introduced it as ""lego electronics"". And it really is. It's really simple to build all the circuits. After a few false starts, my son was building the circuits almost completely by himself. The pieces are simple to snap together. So easy compared to what I remembered.What impressed me the most is the manual. Few toys devote so much effort to the manual. Full color, easy to understand diagrams, and straightforward text.The only thing they could do more of is explain the electricity principles a bit more. However, for mid-twenty-dollars, I can't really complain. And I believe they do have a teachers-companion guide or something like that which presumably has the extra educational material in it.I thought some of the experiments could be grouped differently to make a more logical flow. However, I think they put some thought into interleaving the ""boring-but-important"" projects with more fun noise-making-and-light-flashing ones to keep the kids interested.Overall, an amazing job. I can't imagine how anyone could better this. Fantastic stuff. The guys who came up with this deserve a medal.",learning education

Simply putting in the two AA batteries I got the impression it is a hunk of junk, because the battery contacts stick out too far and have to be bent flat (where you would expect them to be) to get the batteries in.Anyway, I wanted to put the fish food in, so following the arrows in the instructions I turned the clear round thing that holds the food.Big mistake! Apparently you are supposed to hold one part of the feed holder and twist the other. Instead I ended up rotating the barrel just as it would rotate when it dispenses food, and this ""broke"" the thing.This is the same problem another review here talks about. It is not at all obvious that I was doing anything wrong. I even turned it in the direction of the arrow in the instruction sheet.Overall, if you imagine the level of quality of an off-brand cassette tape player, you should know that this product is much worse.

"7-Keto purports to be a lowered-risk-of side effects form of DHEA, an androgenic steroid hormone secreted by the adrenal glands, which are about the size of ping-pong balls and located on top of your kidneys, and, not surprisingly, excreted in urine. Among other things, the adrenal glands function as the control center for the well-known ""fight or flight"" response but ongoing constant stress may create adrenal fatigue or even exhaustion, thus low levels of DHEA (which decreases with age anyway) may aggravate chronic fatigue, depression and decreased sex drive, among other things. However, since DHEA is the precursor hormone to estrogen, progesterone and testosterone poduction, this is no mere ""fountain of youth"" weight-loss aiding nutritional suppement skin and libido candy. Some doctors have asked the FDA to seriously consider whether DHEA and it's newer cousin, 7-Keto, should even be sold without formal counseling of some type. Proponents claim that since formal Western medicin is great at treating full-fledged disease but less skilled (right now) at prevention and reversal of precursor conditions, judicious use of DHEA or this newer and allegedly improved form, 7-Keto, is just another one of those buyer beware situations, and there are a lot worse things one can do legally to one's body than ingest a single supplement daily in this category. Some users claim that this supplement helps with kicking caffeine and other stimulants. Anyway, TwinLab makes quality products, I have a few whiskers on my chinny-chin-chin anyway, and I don't take birth control pills or estrogen supplements, so I don't feel as if I am overdoing it from another direction. And at less than [...] a bottle, I'm eager to see if a two-month course of 7-Keto supplementation helps me gain lean muscle mass and feel friskier overall, but it will be hard to tell since I've been working out more and eating better anyway. So, it's a great value, but a potent form of a supplement some feel is a little risky anyway, so use your own judgment.",nutrition wellness

But if you have business suits, then this may be your only choice.The fact of the a clothing goes into a bag and keeps the protected from the rest of whatever you choose to dry it with is a blessing.

You want to be sure to remove your clothing from the dryer before the dryer stops on its own. Or else, of course, it will lead to wrinkles.In order to clean your clothes, you are given some small pads and a liquid. This does a fine job of cleaning, but it takes work. The surface area of the cleaning bottle is about the size of a Q-tip. For larger stains you may be there a while.This is one of those products that you are at the mercy of. Like needing AA batteries, or some special ingredient for a cake. If you are in a situation where there is no such thing as a dry cleaner, or a dry cleaner they have is worse than simply buying new clothes every month, then this is the only option for you.Think of it as a stopgap, an emergency kit, a last ditch effort in order to make you look good in a suit. This product is a category of its own, and I do not believe it is for the use of those who have dry cleaners in the area.

"I started buying Choline Chloride after reading research into ""smart drugs"" (compounds to enhance cognitive function) some years ago. The theory with Choline Chloride is that it increases the body's access to the chemical building blocks of the neurotransmitter Acetyl Choline and that this access produces an increase in some measures of intellectual ability.Whether or not this works is largely subjective. Its effects are subtle and might be the result of the placebo effect. I only know that when I use it, I tend to write more and faster than when I don't, and that one co-worker who tried it said it gave her the feeling of being ""detached"" or ""disengaged.""Interestingly enough, the liquid form of the compound that you find here is not the only form. Twinlabs offers a powdered form of the compound (""choline cocktail"") to which they add caffeine and various other things in a way that seems not altogether honest. That is, if the actual compound you're paying for has real efficacy on its own, why should the manufacturer have to ramp up the effects with energy-boosting components?I like the liquid version I review here and I prefer it because Vitamin Research at least trusts their product to function on its own without augmentation.

This is an interesting, but odd color scheme, considering that real timber rattlesnakes' skin colors range from yellow to brown with dark bands, some have chevrons. Rarely are they all-black.

"I have a long haired cat, Bob, whose hair was driving a wedge between my husband and I. We have several suaded microfiber duvet covers that I'd have to change several days a week because of his hair collecting on them. Tumbleweeds of hair would blow across the floor, and worst of the worst, the invisible hairs that would stick to the eyeballs.Because Bob's an all access kitty (he has his own key and can move in and out of the house without us - and he has his own 'condo' on our enclosed porch), my husband was insisting that he come no further than the porch.So I bought this hoping that it would do as it states, and WoW. Bob hates it, so we fight everyday, but it's reduced the amt of hair in the house dramatically. And over the past weeks, he's just accepted his fate and lays there and takes it.

"If you're looking for non-surgical ways to lose weight, the best track is FEWER CALORIES & EXERCISE. Eating smaller meals is one way to reduce caloric intake. Eating the same size meals with fewer calories is another. Or, lastly, stop the food that you injest from actually being absorbed by your body.Alli works on the principle of the latter, by blocking your body's ability to digest injested fat. And, in contrast to a lot of ads you might see on television, IT WORKS! YAY! I really have to congratulate whatever scientists actually figured out how to do this.Ok, but here's the downside. IT WORKS. Your body doesn't digest the fat, so it just goes through the rest of your digestive tract... and causes all sorts of unpleasant side effects along the way. They're really unpleasant. Seriously. I can't begin to convey how remarkably unpleasant they actually are. No matter what you heard, you will not be prepared. I actually took prescription Orlistat when it came out a few years ago, and, after stopping due to the side effects, I was *still* not prepared when I started Alli again recently.On the other hand, the side effects give you this great incentive to stay away from the pizza & deep fried chicken!!!For me, I eat remarkably healthy most of the time. I try and basically eliminate the need for Alli. But every so often, I get dragged to a business/social dinner or have to travel with few healthy food options available to me. In those cases where eating poorly is totally unavoidable, it's really nice to have Alli in my pocket.",nutrition wellness

"This toy takes more effort to get food out than the Buster Cube, which I like because it occupies the dog longer. I find that the cube, even on its ""hardest"" setting only takes a few minutes to get out most of the food, and then the rest doesn't come out no matter how long the dogs work it. With the bottle the dogs can get nearly all the food out if they keep at it.At first you should fill the bottle so that it is over half full. This way food can come out more easily when it is on its side. This will encourage the dog to play with it. Once the food level goes down food will only come out as they toss and pull the bottle. It took my dog a few days to get to this, but now she seems to have mastered it. She stands the bottle up and knocks it over, putting food into the neck, then she works the rope a bit and manages to get a piece of kibble out. When I first got the toy I thought she would never be able to figure it out, but she has. Even so, it takes a fair amount of work to get out just a few pieces of food, so it can keep them occupied all day.",dogs

We shouldn't have worried-- both cats took to the litterbox just fine and actually use it more frequently than they did our previous litterbox. For our cat with urinary problems, this is an added bonus since cats tend to develop urinary problems partly due to not using the box frequently enough.

"Normally, when we've brought home cat treats, one or two of our three cats will like them, and one or two won't. They're picky.With Greenies, they all go bonkers. We just need to start opening the bag and all three come running. It's become a reliable way to track them all down.One of them has figured out how to open the cabinet we used to keep them in, so we've had to get more creative about hiding them. The contortions he goes through to open the cabinet are incredible. Naturally when he finds a bag he opens it himself, and he doesn't use the zip lock seal, or follow the recommended limit of no more than six treats at a time.Try a small bag to see if your cats like them, but I'm now buying them in bulk.They like them better than catnip.",cats
This is a really nice bar for massages. The girls at my local Lush store love to push it as a lotion bar in addition to massages. This is not so. It is too oily for lotion purposes.I do love the scent. It is fresh and light. It soothes and relaxes. I do love the way it makes massages feel. This bar even has fun spots to stick your fingers while using it on your partner. You will need a good shower after the massage unless your skin is super dry. Also one thing to note is a little bit goes a long way. Do not use this bar to massage just use it to spread the oil where needed.,health care

"I bought this for my Elmo-obsessed 19 month old. She's thrilled with the pictures of Elmo that are on the toy, and she likes spinning the block with his picture on it; however, the thrill only lasts a few seconds. The toy is way to heavy for her to lift herself. Two of the picture blocks have upside-down pictures (probably why this toy is on sale).As she gets older, I'm sure she'll be able to lift it, and she'll have fun recognizing the numbers and letters and counting and making words. The letters are color coded so that the kids can self-check spelling words that match up with the pictures. I think this toy could have made better use of word families so that there would be more word possiblilities to be formed by spinning the letter blocks.All in all, for a child who is crazy about Elmo, it might be worth the [..] I spent on it. Otherwise, I'd say there are other toys out there that are better suited to help a child learn letters and how to spell words.",learning education

"Our cat always just jumped over the side of the litter box, missing any ramps or mats meant to catch ""crumbs"" and scattering litter all over the bathroom.This box solves that problem, with a little fixing up. Like other reviewers, I trimmed down a plastic cutting mat to fit across the gap where a wall ought to be, but isn't. Perhaps the Booda people know about this fix, because there is slot at the top of the stairs where you can attach one end of the mat. Just poster taped the other end, and presto! we now have at least 90% better litter containment.I do think Booda should either fix this problem or supply the plastic piece with purchase, given the price they charge. However, I'm willing to overlook one small problem since the rest of the box is great. It's pretty attractive for a litter box, and the top lifts off easily for cleaning.The trick to getting the top back on tightly is to slide the top into the groove on the outer edge of the stairs on first, then the one on the inside of the stairs, then push the back down until it is firmly attached. Once the lid is on correctly it isn't going to just pop off when the cat bumps it - and I'm pretty sure ours is doing aerobics in there ;)",cats

"Got the litter box about 3 weeks ago and our 3 cats took to it within 2-3 days. They say with one cat it'll last 30 days and from my experience with 3 cats (I can stretch it about 10 days), that is right in line with their claims.I don't know what kind of mega-whizzing-craptastic cats these people with one cat who say it only lasts one week have... If this wont last for one week with a single cat, you better bring em to a vet. I have one small cat, one large one, and an old one that pees all the time and the cartridge handles them easily for a week plus.The crystals really do a great job of capturing the smell -- just mix em up every couple days to spread out any uneven wetness spots (like if your cat prefers using one corner).The only downside is the cost.. $45 a month is pretty high to maintain the box for 3 cats. Planning on trying out one of the ""forever"" refillable litter trays with my own bag of Fresh Step crystals.UPDATE 12/28/07 -- With 3 cats, I can go a full two weeks, product still awesome..

"I have been an owner of a Dog Gone Device for around 10 years. It has been a wonderful product. Very comfortable to wear and easy to use. I keep it in the trunk of my car, so I can bring my Maltese dog on hikes and bicycle rides, and even into some select stores. My dog loves hiking and biking with me in his Dog Gone Device, and he's very comfortable in it. In fact, he gets downright excited every time I bring it out! It's made of a thick mesh material, allowing air to circulate through it, keeping my dog cool. It is the same Dog Gone Device shown in the product photos. However, I was in a local pet store yesterday, and saw a brand new one for sale. The packaging had a photo of the mesh version, just like what I have, but in looking inside the packaging, I noticed a very different version of the Dog Gone Device. The material they are now using to make the Dog Gone Device is not practical at all. They no longer make them out of thick, sturdy mesh, which allows the dog to have air circulation. Instead, they now use a different material - the same material you would find in any other back pack",dogs

"We are on our third large ""Canine Cooler"" bed and HIGHLY recommend this product for non-chewing hot dogs.We first bought one for our long-haired Belgian Shepherd, who ultimately reached 130lbs. He spent every night of his life going between his ""hot bed"" (a typical foam bed) and his ""cool bed."" Over the course of seven years, we only replaced the Canine Cooler once because the inner sponge has broken into pieces after years of use.Our even-hotter Newfy puppy inherited the used Canine Cooler bed, but chewed on the corner. We taped it up with duct tape, but once he was six months old, we got him a new one and he now spends his nights going between his softer Canine Cooler cool bed and his harder - but even cooler - marble slab. (Yes, he has several big soft dog beds, but he finds them too hot to lay on for more than a minute or two unless he's wet from a bath or swim.)Like the advertizing says, the Canine Cooler isn't cold, but it is cool and amazingly stays cool when a warm body lays on it. They sell covers for it, but we never use anything over it because it reduces the cool effect that our dogs really need. It's well worth the cost for a hot dog.",dogs

She never really looked CLEANED (she would dry dull looking and have to be brushed to look HALF WAY decent--which she never did). I thought lets give this PET JET a try!!! I am so HAPPY with this item already after one use. The hook-up is soooooo easy---the 3 spray options are GREAT---all one-handed use---having the shampoo in the handle of the Jet Pet---the WATER PRESSURE from this pet jet is unbelieveable !!!! The bathing time is more than cut in half with the Pet Jet. After one use, there was a definite difference in her coat (reason being)the Pet Jet rinses ALL the shampoo and conditioner COMPLETELY OUT (because of the pressure from the Pet Jet)so her coat doesn't have the Residue left behind from the shampoo and conditioner (as i had from using the kitchen sprayer even though I thought I had rinsed her completely).

"The only reason this product gets a poor review is due to the massage feature. The memory foam is great and contours to my back. However, the massage feature is built into a plastic box within the memory foam. If you apply to much pressure, you feel the platic pressing against your back. I used it about five minutes in the car before I couldn't take it any longer. The batteries and plastic kept pressing into my back.

"Like many, I was excited when I first bought this machine 14 months ago. Being a dog guy with a cat wife, I was glad to not have to scoop the poop everyday. I give this machine credit that it did do a pretty good job for quite awhile. Granted you will have stuff stick to the rack often, especially if your cat goes in the same place. If the thing stops working, customer service will have you press the relay buttons which normally help.However after 14 months, resetting the buttons didn't help and now it seems dead. Littermaid offered a discount which with shipping came out to how much I spent in the first place. So for me it's not worth the money to possibly have to replace it at another 14 months, just outside the warranty period. But that's the risk of electronics I guess.",cats

"We adopted two cats from a rescue shelter, a male first and then a female a couple of days later. They got along okay in the beginning but became more and more jealous of each other. The male had to be the boss of everything...food, toys and attention. The female started getting back at him about two months later by wetting in his favorite hang-out spots on the floor and then on my husband's leather recliner. I tried Nature's Miracle on the carpet first but it didn't work. The smell was still there and she went back and wet on the same spot.After researching online and reading the reviews and tips from other customers, I ordered a gallon of Urine Off For Cats through Amazon, as well as a blacklight from Walmart and a big marinade infuser syringe from Linens N Things. The blacklight found spots we were unaware of, including under the recliner. I took masking tape and marked the area about 6"" beyond each spot on the carpet and then marked spots about 4"" apart within each circle. I poured about 3 cups of Urine Off into a 4 cup measuring cup to make it easier to draw the solution into the syringe. Then I injected each spot with a full syringe of Urine Off, marking each spot with an X in pen on the masking tape as I went along so I knew where I had already injected. Eventually the tip on the syringe was bending so I found that it was easier to use a big skewer to poke the hole first and then push the syringe into the carpet. When I finished injecting, I then filled a pump sprayer with the solution and saturated the top of the carpet. I covered the spots with plastic garbage bags for 2 days and then allowed them to air dry.For the leather recliner I had to pull the leather covers away from the back of the cushions and spray the leather both inside and out and around the zippers. I injected the cushions with the syringe like I did the carpet and put them in garbage bags. I also put a plastic tarp under the chair and sprayed everywhere the urine may have gone on top and underneath of the chair including any padding and all of the metal and springs. Then I covered it all with plastic bags for 2 days before letting it air dry. Check the cushions to be sure mold doesn't start growing. I removed them from the plastic early. I used a leather conditioner afterwards to restore the pliability to the leather. The metal underneath began to rust in some places, but it came off with WD 40 when we treated the hinges afterwards.I wish I could say I only had to do all of this work once, but I had to repeat it a second time before all of the smell was gone to my sensitive nose. To be fair, the directions say it may take two or more treatments for the smell to be eliminated. Also, I had used the Nature's Miracle on the two small spots I was aware of first which may have made it harder for the Urine Off to work. I'm sure I didn't get down to the subfloor with the Nature's Miracle and I didn't cover it with plastic. In fact, I used a fan on it to dry it faster which I now know is the opposite of what you should do. But because the Urine Off directions said you had to saturate the carpet, the padding and the subfloor below the padding, and also to widen the area that you treat beyond the original spots, I had to buy a 2nd gallon. To repeat the process, I bought a 3rd gallon. But the end result is that we don't smell any urine odor. Only a slight lemony smell of the solution remains. I was able to save our $1800 recliner, but sadly, my husband insisted that our female cat go back to the rescue shelter. I'm sure she will be much better off as an only cat who is queen of her castle just as our boy enjoys being king.",cats

"I had an eye pillow made by a different manufacturer for about 10 years before it finally tore open. Unable to see how I could live without it, I repaired it with duct tape (hey, I'm a guy, what do you expect), but I figured it was time to get a new one. I was pleased to see on Amazon that many eye pillows, such as the DreamTime eye pillow on this page, come with zippers so the contents can be removed and the material hand-washed. I got a different color than the one on this page (I got the ""DreamTime Inner Peace Eye Pillow, Sage Velvet,"" also sold here at Amazon). The eye pillow that tore open on me was unscented and I was hesitant about getting a scented eye pillow; I was afraid it would be too perfumy. But the scent of the DreamTime eye pillow is quite pleasant and to my liking and I don't find it perfumy at all. It has a mild chamomile smell, and when I use it, it is easy for me to imagine that I am reclining in a field of wild chamomile. Having an eye pillow means not having to put my arm or arms over my eyes (or a folded up t-shirt or a towel or whatever is handy) when I want total darkness. The eye pillow gives me total darkness--100% absolute blackness. It also imparts the pleasant sensation that I get when I gently press my palms to my eyes. The scent is relaxing, the sensation of having the pillow over my eyes is relaxing, the absolute darkness is relaxing, and I highly recommend this inexpensive product (especially at the sale price) to anyone who is looking for a natural way to get some deep relaxation. DreamTimes's eye pillow comes in a sturdy reusable cardboard box (with a ribbon carrying handle). DreamTime eye pillows are obviously marketed to women and that's too bad for guys who might not consider trying them because of how they're marketed. Maybe if they make some with a camo design (just kidding). Highly recommended for anyone who wants a natural aid to deep relaxation.",health care

"My wife and I have owned the Cat Genie for about 4 weeks now and love it. When I first read about it, I thought it was a joke and couldn't stop laughing at the cat toilet that someone had 'invented', but the thing really works well. We have 2 cats (sisters, 9 months old) and they seem to do very well with it. One of the cats started using it immediately and preferred it over the old litter box. The other took about a week to train (suggested time frame from the company). In the training process there were a couple of accidents, but they were all in our laundry room. Ironically, one of the accidents was on the instruction manual for the Cat Genie! After this initial phase-in of 1-1.5 weeks, we haven't had any problems. We set the device to clean itself 2 times per day when our cats are inactive (4am and 4pm) and that works well. We have it hooked up to our laundry drain pipe for waste disposal and that works well (no clogs so far, although I have heard that others have problems if the waste isn't removed often enough, i.e. less than once per day)We both love the device and think that it is worth the price that is being charged and the fact that we don't have to scoop and dispose of normal cat litter. We had been thinking about getting one of the other 'automatic' litter boxes, but you still have to empty these devices on a weekly basis and I've heard that they don't work well.As with any consumer product there are faults, but I feel the gains much out way the faults.Pros:-The first fully automatic litter box!-only $ 330 (not much for what it does)-relatively reliable (could take vacation without too much worry for litter box, although I would want someone to check-in once or twice)-The box is always clean for the cats (they seem to prefer this now that they are used to it)-The plastic litter pellets are clean and are easy to sweep upCons:-somewhat loud (not as loud as a washing machine though)-litter pieces tend to scatter out (we are buying a special hood that just came out)-smell of cleaning solution is strong (it is a pleasant smell, but it smells like cleaning solution in a large part of the house for an hour after a cleaning cycle)-$330. Thats a lot of money for anything, but especially on a litter box-somewhat large (the bowl is larger than a standard toilet bowl, but is about the same size as our previous litter box, so it makes sense I guess)Also, some people complain about the cost of the consumables (litter pellets, and cleaning solution), but I think I agree with the company in that the consumables cost about the same price as the normal litter, if not a bit cheaper.Improvements I would like to see for V2.0:-more flexible cleaning times (for 2 times per day it cleans 12 hrs apart, 3 cycles is 8 hrs apart, and so on). I would like it to clean at 4am and at 1pm but this isn't possible now.-It would be nice if it came with a hood, but that is an add-on now-deeper litter depth (right now it can only allow for 3-4cm of litter depth and its seems like our cats would like to bury their waste a little deeper-quieter cleaning cycles (but a more flexible cleaning time cycle would make this point moot if we were gone for the day or asleep)-smaller total size, although the litter bowl size is about perfectSo, if you have the initial $330 for a litter box and want it to be automatic, then this thin is awesome and I highly recommend it. However, if your mission is to save money, then it doesn't make sense as a purchase.Hope this was helpful!",cats

"Cascade manufactures a great product with their water-soluble pouches of dishwasher detergent. These pouches take all the mess and guess work out of adding the dishwater detergent to your dishwasher before you start it up. Just place one pouch, unopened, into the main dispenser cup (not any other cup) of your dishwasher, close the dispenser cup if you have to--and then just turn on the dishwasher! The pouch with its soap and Dawn gives you very clean dishes that actually DO shine just as Amazon notes that they do. Great!The pouches cause no harm to septic tanks; and your dishwasher runs just fine with them instead of the regular dishwasher detergent you may have used up until now.After the dishwasher cycle is over, simply remove the pouch from the dispenser cup and discard it. Make sure that every time you take a pouch out of the plastic bag they come in that you reseal that plastic bag to help maintain the freshness of the remaining dishwasher detergent pouches.This form of dishwasher soap mixed with Dawn and a mild cinnamon apple spice scent gives you such shiny, clean dishes that it becomes addictive! This product does the job of cleaning your dishes marvelously; and once you try them you'll be hooked just as I am now. SMILE In addition, one reviewer notes that these packages will save you the effort of carrying very heavy containers of detergent from your grocery store. They come out to cost about 22 cents per dishwasher cycle; and I guess that's about the right price for a sophisticated product like this one with all its excellent packaging.The only caveat is that this does have a cinnamon apple spice scent to it. If you are allergic to any scents or perfumes try an unscented form of dishwasher detergent.Overall, I highly recommend this product for anyone who has a dishwasher and cares to try to just make things easier for themselves when it comes to loading up the dishwasher or preparing it for a wash cycle. These bags make for no muss/no fuss deal; and that's quite all right in my book!Use them in good health!",household supplies

They are relatively high in sugar (29 grams per 1/4 cup) and they lack vitamins. I'll have to take off one star for that.However, if you want a healthy snack or something to add to your breakfast cereal or oatmeal, these raisins are excellent.

It seemed to work out fine, but the next day I noticed that the pool was very lopsided. It was leaning heavily to one side and slopping water out all over the yard. It also appeared to have lost some of its air. I thought the problem could probably be solved if the ground surface was leveled out to some degree. I drained the pool and make a level surface with some plywood and I added extra support beneath it on the side that the pool had been leaning towards. I laid the ground tarp over this and set the pool up again. I had to partially reinflate it to compensate for the lost air, but there didn't appear to be any leaks. I refilled it and the problem appeared to be fixed...we used it the next day. At that time, I did notice one new problem...but I thought it was purely cosmetic",sports outdoor play

"I have a love/hate relationship with my Scoop Free. If I had to do it again, I'm not sure I'd buy it.I have 3 cats and 2 litter boxes -- the Scoop Free and a traditional box with crystal litter. One of my cats uses the Scoop Free box consistently, one won't go near the thing and only uses the traditional box, and one likes to choose between the 2 based on some algorithm known only to him.So I have 1.5 cats using the Scoop Free. And the cartridges don't even last me a week! The litter doesn't get very dirty, but the refuse side of the box fills up way too quickly. I use top of the line cat food (California Naturals) available only at the specialty store, so I doubt my cats poop more than usual.One thing I really hate is that when the refuse side gets too full, the rake will actually catch on the old poop and pull it back into the box, where it gets stuck BEHIND the rake. This is very difficult to clean and smells horrible.In fact, the box smells pretty bad in general because the refuse side is not air tight and the 20 min lag between the cat pooping and the rake scooping it up does not give adequate time for the poop to dry out.Also, do NOT be fooled by the web site video that shows the lady easily carrying the used cartridge to the trash and throwing it in. The used cartridge is heavy & unbalanced. You could easily drop the thing all over the floor - GROSS! I bring my lawn-size trash bag over to the unit and ease the cartridge in - and the lid never stays on. You have to tie that sucker up quick to avoid the overwhelming stench.All the negative aside, if I change the cartridge every 5 days, the unit really does a pretty good job. But the refills are awfully expensive to be changing every 5 days. It's not an ideal situation.Oh yes, one more thing -- this unit is LOUD! I keep it in the bathroom, which is connected to the bedroom, of course, and it sometimes wakes me up in the middle of the night.UPDATE 12/28/07I've finally just stopped using mine. It's way too expensive to buy the cartridges, and the rake/grate is just GROSS - everything sticks to it and there is really no easy way to clean.Someday, someone will invent a scoop free box that actually works.

I hope this doesn't go on much longer or she may wear me down (it's only been 2 days though). The only reason I'm writing is to point out something that I didn't think of when choosing the color--litter and its dust shows up a great deal on the black model.

I can then give him a pouch of food at the times that I am home and I don't have to worry about him overeating or going hungry at any point in the day.

"Just to clarify, Freddie is my cat, he's 15 years old and has been obsessed with fresh water. He used to jump up to the kitchen sink, drink from the toilet, try to get a drop from the shower, even though I supplied him a dish of fresh water daily. I thought my sweet cat was neurotic. One day a few weeks ago I saw the petmate fountain in a store and decided to give it a try. Freddie is like a changed cat! He hangs out next to the pet fountain and drinks a lot of water, he's more content and obviously has found his dream of good, clean everfresh water, its a joy to see. I was so impressed I bought a second (jumbo) sized fountain because I travel for 2-4 days sometimes. The water in the jumbo lasts him for 7 days, then I wash the container and the pump and re-fill it. Set up was VERY easy and cleaning it and the little pump is a cinch. A wonderful invention with a very nice, streamlined, modern style. I really give this fountain a full thumbs up!",cats

I tend to eat them for breakfast when I am late for work, or take them for lunch if I don't have time to make it the night before. So why this flavor? First of all, it has whole almonds in it, which I find add a satisfying crunch to the chewy bar. Also, with some of the other fruit bars, the distinct fruit flavors don't come out, it's more a ""fruity flavor"" in general.

Both my dogs fit the ""girth measurement"" but the loop where the leash attaches drags on the ground. My two dogs were able to walk out of the thing and kept getting their front legs tangled up. Also there is one dimension where the harness can't be adjusted so you might find, as I did, that the girth measurement is correct, but it still is too big for your dog. The description should have warned the owners of ""short"" dogs that this would not be a good choice.If you want to try this out on your dog, buy it from a dealer who will refund ALL the purchase price without a 20% restocking fee.

The display gives all the information I need to know the status of each cell (4 completely independent and programmable channels) and it lets me fully control the charging process. This is of great value to me.The charger reports the actual capacity of each cell based on the current delivered during the discharge cycle in the programs that do discharging, so you know after the cycle is complete what the capacity of each cell is, and you can use that to match the cells for use in groups; and also to determine which cells need more cycling to return their capacity.Great charger, I am so glad I bought this baby.",household supplies

That initiative will give them the gift of a longer, healthier life, eliminate many chronic health issues that pets face, save you money in vet bills in the long run... the list of benefits goes on and on.I have done extensive research on canine and feline nutrition and I highly recommend, if you are going to feed commercial food, Welless, California Naturals or Innova. For a great complete meal, I give my dogs all one of those dry foods mixed with a little bit of canned from the same brands, water for hydration, a touch of a good quality essential oil (such as olive, flax, etc.), a touch of powdered kelp and alfalfa, a splash of organic apple cider vinegar, Prozyme digestive enzymes to unlock the nutrients in all that good food and top with a dollop of plain yogurt.

"I bought these batteries for use with my Canon S2 digital camera. I was having trouble with typical nimh batteries because I would charge a spare pair of batteries for use when the main pair died. But I was finding that the ones I charged a few weeks ago would be almost fully discharged by the time I would swap them. This was really annoying and pretty much defeated the purpose of having rechargeables... I had to use alkalines instead. But this new so called 'hybrid'/low discharge technology finally solves this problem. Of course it does not solve it completely because these batteries still discharge over time... just a lot slower, but at least now I know I have a pair of batteries that are at least 80 percent or so charged when I swap them. This technology was actually developed by an small independent company and licensed for use with all the major battery companies now. For instance, Sony is also utilizing it in their new batteries now. To me, this demonstrates how well it works.So how does it hold up in real life? Pretty darn well, actually. I noticed that these particular batteries last really long in my Canon S2. I haven't had the problem of charged batteries being totally discharged by the time I swap them anymore. So if you're having similar problems with your older Nimh batteries, I would recommend giving these batteries a try. But don't feel limited to this brand, there are many other brands utilizing this technology and I've used other brands with the same great results.Tip",household supplies

No, it is not adjustable, as one reviewer claimed (unless by adjustable they mean you can move the whole thing around).

"I have the SD-1800 and love it. I have a 130lb, 18 month old Rhodesian Ridgeback. I have had other breeds of dogs (German Shepherds, Rotties, etc... with no problems), but I was amazed how big he got and how fast it happened. Rigdgebacks are very stubborn dogs on top of all of this. They are a breed that if not trained to know who the boss is, will continually test their limits.I tried training classes, chokers, and finally a pinch collar. He didn't even flinch, nor did he ever listen. I have a four year old son who was frightened by him, not because he was mean, but because he would knock him over, climb all over him and scratch him with his paws while trying to play with him. He just did what he wanted when he wanted. He would run full force into me and wipe me out, knocking me on the ground with his enthusiasm. He tackled strangers, tables, anything he wanted. Never in a mean way, he never growled or anything close to showing aggression. He was fine with anyone near his crate or food bowl, so he wasn't a mean dog. He was just out of control. He was meant to be an indoor dog, but his behavior had him spending most of time in our yard. I was saddened that I might have to find him a new home.This collar was my last option and I am so glad that I tried it. I was so afraid that it wouldn't be strong enough and he wouldn't respond. He has a very high pain threshold. But I was greatly surprised. After 5 minutes on this collar he was no longer knocking me over. My first goal was to teach him ""no."" It took about 4 times to say it with the collar on and pressing the button, before he was responding to ""no"" without me having to press any buttons. He is great to be around now. He still charges me when he sees me and is excited, but he comes to a complete stop about a foot in front of me and then sits for me to pet him and love on him. I don't even need him on a leash anymore. He responds to my commands easily.On the technical aspects of this product, I love that it is completely waterproof, not just water resistant. We have two ponds on our property that he loves to jump in. So that is a great benefit. The remote is small and easy to use. And it is also waterproof. Both can be submerged completely in water and be fine. This is not considered a ""throw away"" collar, meaning if it is broke, you can still fix it. I looked at the models that were cheaper by other companies, but for a little more in price, I was able to get one that would last much longer.Needless to say, I love this collar!

Our Pablo has been through quite a bit including trips through the washer and dryer yet he still looks almost as nice as the day that we bought him.

"""Linteater"" works quickly, easily, and very well. Our dryer's duct is less than 9 feet long, so it only took about 10 minutes to do the job. A fair amount of lint came out, but considering that the duct hasn't been cleaned in over 14 years, we probably were lucky that there wasn't more, and that the duct wasn't clogged.The instructions are really clear, and the 7 minute DVD shows just what to do. Two things to remember are to ONLY turn the rods & brush clockwise (otherwise, they'll unscrew inside the duct), and to get the current extension rod almost completely into the duct before attaching the next one.The instructions also said to work from the outside towards the dryer, and to remove the duct from the dryer in advance, then connect a shop vac to pull the loosened lint into the vac as you work from the outside.I did work from the outside, but was concerned about leaving a shop vac running inside the house while I was outside. So, I left the duct connected, made sure the dryer was OFF, and just reamed out the lint. Pushed the brush and three rods in until there was resistance (presumably inside the dryer), running a cordless drill at low-moderate speed all the way.After removing the brush and rods (still turning clockwise), I turned the dryer on AIR (not heat) to flush out the loosened lint. By the time I got back outside, about a gallon of lint was on the ground. Tossed the lint into the trash, put away the LintEater, and was done.Maybe using the shop vac would have made the duct even cleaner, and maybe this approach won't work on a longer duct or one with more angles (this duct only has two right-angle turns), but the results seem great, and it only took 10 minutes.Regarding the $40 price",household supplies

"I can't believe how much my cats like this toy, even the cynical, hardened, I-can't-be-bothered tomcats. It took me a while to get the hang of making Da Bird fly (once airborne, you can make the feathers quiver and rotate like a fishing lure), but I could play with the kitties for hours, and they'd never tire of it. We now have 15 minutes of play time at least twice a day, and they are sleeping better and squabbling less often -- and with 6 cats, that's an improvement.I have seen some seriously impressive cat acrobats in the last 24 hours, since Da Bird arrived on our doorstep. Most amusing is when they catch it. They get this look on their face (*my* dead bird!) and they trot off to an isolated location (with me trailing behind, holding onto the wand), so they can kill it. When play time is over, I have to hide Da Bird in a closet or they'd never let it rest. Best $10 I EVER spent on my cats. Ever.",cats

"The concept is great. My cats love flowing water. BUT do not waste your money on THIS product. LOUD AND BADLY DESIGNED. I actually like the sound of running water far better than a constantly humming motor. People that reviewed this product and said the motor is quiet either have TV on constantly or have small noisy children running around to mask the CONSTANT humm.I agree that you have to take it apart to clean the motor from pet hair and that a nylon stocking helps eliminate that problem. However, what the other reiewers forget to tell you is that it takes about 15 to 20 minutes to put the product back together again each time, due to poor product design. The pump has to line up with a rigid plastic hole while you hold the rigid plastic gate in place and keep the rigid plastic cord keeper from falling off. If you manage to get all those pieces lined up, then there is still all the plastic nipples that have to go in the plastic holes to hold the top in place. It is a nightmare of poor product design! Why should I have to put a nylon sock over something to make it work when I purchased it because it says it works??? It also says the motor is quiet. It is not, even with a sock.If people actually like this product for convinience over its faults it is because we, as Americans,are too used to wasting our money on poor producuts and bad designs then throwing them away and purchasing more. Do not waste your money on this product.",cats
"I was intrigued by the prospects of Alli. Isn't it wonderful? Just take a pill and you will lose weight and look great! It sounds too good to be true and unfortunately upon further research, I discovered that it is.First of all, people lose very little weight. I found out that Alli is not a new product at all. It has been around for long time and sold by prescription. Then Roche sold the pattern to GlaxoSmithKline. Glaxo repackaged it, gave it a new name and started selling it as the new wonder drug Alli. This raised my first red flag. If the drug really worked, why would Roche sell the golden hen to Glaxo? I quickly found the answers right in the company brochure. It only blocks 25% of the fats!You can achieve this only by skipping snacks or avoiding sodas! To mask the impotency of the drug Glaxo instructs to have a healthy diet and exercise. If the drug doesn't work, you do not follow the instructions! If it works, most of the benefit may be coming from your new diet and exercise any way. Very clever!Second of all, I am really concerned about the health risks associated with the drug. In addition to the inconvenient and embarrassing well-documented side effects, I am worried that there are other long-term, more damaging risks which will start to emerge. I know that the drug was FDA approved but so was Vioxx, Ephedra and other drugs dangerous drugs. After all, this is unnatural, chemical way to lose weight. I will not be surprised if the concerns that it may cause cancer or other serious illnesses may turn to be true. I refuse to be the testing mice! I would rather go with a safer, common sense diet plan like Weight Watchers or Nutrisystem.In summary, I found that Alli is a marketing product which plays perfectly to fast gain, no pain customers. However, after I took a careful second look I saw a lot of pain and no gain.",nutrition wellness

This bp monitor is the only one that I have found with interchangeable cuffs. It is the only machine that I have found where you can adjust the rate at which the cuff deflates which is what you need to use a small cuff.

I decided to buy these at Amazon.com because they are such a better price than I could find them in stores. An added bonus was that Stacy's brand is our favorite in terms of taste (compared to Trader Joe's and other store brands) but they are normally more expensive per bag, so it was nice to find them on sale. However, I will note that I bought these as part of a promo (one of those save $$ off a purchase) so I don't know if they will be as good of a deal in the future.The only downside of ordering these (and other items from Amazon grocery) is that since they come in bulk, you end up with a lot of the product at a time.

Rayovac developed these batteries several years ago as part of a program to revitalize the company. They are somewhat more expensive than most rechargeables but the rapid re-charge feature more than justifies the price. In addition to the rapid recharge feature their 2300 mAh capacity insures very long life. I've been able to take over 400 photos on a Fuji S3100 and still have some charge left. Since these are NiMH batteries the user does not have to worry about battery memory - just give them a charge and go. I would guess my first set has been recharged around 250 times. They have shown no sign of deterioration so far. This product is a winner.,household supplies

My 8 year old kids can manage 5 disks (31 moves) without much trouble and they are beginning to see the recursive pattern. Going to 6 disks (61 moves) is a little too much for their attention span.

Read on....My 2 year old has just begun to idolize Elmo and we were soooo excited when we found this toy for him. Before I got it, I came home and read some not great reviews. When I found out they had a newer version, I was hopeful. I bought they Say Your Name Elmo, (version 2.0, production date 2007, packaged in a blue box). I followed the directions exactly. I started by downloading the software into my computer. Once downloaded, you enter your kids info into the program and upload it to Elmo. Pretty cool idea, right? Elmo would have known not only his name, but his favorite foods, animals, colors, songs, games, etchIt would have made my kid sooooo happy IF the software worked. I couldn't even get the software to download to my computer. I know my way around computers and was able to eventually find a way to install it. But the program was glitchy and buggy. I wasn't able to enter several of his favorite. Disappointed but still happy to have Elmo say my child's name and ask him if he wants strawberries (favorite food), I continued on with the process. I finally got to point where the settings are supposed to upload to the doll via USB cable. It didn't work. I tried everything.The directions say that if there are issues to please not return the item to the store, call FP Customer Service and they will help you fix the problem. Reluctant to waste any more time, I did. The rep, ar first, tried to convince me that the disc was dirty and if I clean it, all would be fine. Once he figured out that I was not a dumba**, he suddenly seemed curiously familiar with the problem I described. My take is that he has this many times before...he knew the exact error code and even finished my sentences a couple times as I was describing.So ok, the solution",stuffed animals plush
I've used this product for my dog for over a year since taking other pain meds upset her stomach which is already not that good.I can't see that it helps her in anyway. I just kept giving them to her thinking well maybe it is working but I'm giving up on them.,dogs

"My cat has CRF, her BUN & Creatinine was off the chart. we would could have retested with a diluted blood sample to get an actual reading. she was getting twice weekly SubQ injections but no longer. i dose her with 1/2 spoon 2x daily directly into her mouth as she rejects any food combined with the med. this is her 3rd month on epakitin. she is on no other meds or treatments.she seems to be perfectly normal, chases butterflies etc. this was definitely a life saver for de'ana.",cats

My only complaint is that I generally require two or three attempts before the cuff fully inflates. Accurate placement of the cuff is necessary or else you will get an error message.

"This is the best spray by far. The stores in our area used to carry it and took it out and replaced with Febreze, which I don't like. I contacted All Company and no one did anything.

The Fresh Rain smells fine and glad I found on Amazon. Thanks Jackie",household supplies
My boyfriend gave it to me a couple of months ago and I had no idea how popular it was. I believe he bought it while waiting for me at the San Antonio airport. I fell in love with it immediately.

"I've tried several retractable leads and this is my favorite. It costs more than I think a leash should, but is very comfortable and durable. I had my last one for several years and the only problem I had was that my new dog chewed it up - so I bought a new one. It extends smoothly, the lock works well, and it is very comfortable to hold. I've purchased cheaper leads from discount stores and had them break within a year (and they were far less comfortable to hold).",dogs
"There are no trans fats in these chips, so consuming a bag may make you feel guilty, but it will only enlarge your butt, not your heart.

"I bought this item for my daughter as a birhtday gift. It said ""Allow 2-6 weeks for delivery."" I could not believe it took 7 months to ship ants. Also the manual said ""You'll receive 25 to 30 ----- ants."" My daughter received only 11 ants and 8 of 11 were already dead. Only 3 ants could not do anything. They died 2 weeks later and the green gel got moldy. This defective item made my daughter very upset. I wasted money.",learning education

"This is a light, fluffy snack, with no oilyresidue. It seems better than most microwavedpopcorn. Salt content is not too heavy.

I bought this puzzle for my husband to enjoy. It took him almost a week to finish it. He really liked it because it was a little more challenging than some puzzles he's worked. It's a beautiful puzzle too. (The puzzle was well made and sturdy. The reason I gave it 4 stars on durability is it's a puzzle and in my opinion they're less durable than other types of toys.),puzzles
"This product delivers. I didn't believe it would do what it claimed (reduce shedding up to 70%) but I thought at least it could reduce it somewhat and every little bit helps. Not only did it reduce the shedding by 70%, I believe it has reduced it by more than that. In addition, my dog (a lab mix) now has a coat that is extremely soft and shiny. It definitely took 6+ weeks to see results (as stated on the label instructions), and those results are no less than stellar.",dogs
"This product is AWESOME! It scoups, washes and dries the litter then pumps the waste out!I've had this product for about 3-4 months and all i have to do is change the sanitizer cartridge and add litter once a month! I have only one cat and have the unit set to run twice per day.I also had the littermaid and this BLOWS IT AWAY!!! I was always cleaning the LitterMaid-GROSS!!!Cons:- a bit noisy, sounds like a washing machine only half as loud- does not automatically run cleaning cycle immediately after the cat uses it like the littermaid does.- You can set it to run 1-4 times daily. 1 = every 24 hours, 2 = every 12 hours, 3 = every 8 hours and 4 = every 6 hours. I have mine set to twice daily which means if my cats decides to go #2 just after a cleaning cycle and i'm not there to manually ""flush"" it the waste will fester there for 12 hours.if this were an automatic scouper like the litter maid i would give it 10 stars!!!!",cats

"My dog is a puller and after much obedience training, we decided to buy the Gentle Leader. He was making walking a difficult chore and hurting himself in the process. You need to read the instructions or watch the DVD before you try to put this on for the first time. My dog did not like it at first, but began to learn that it was a good signal when I pulled it out of the closet because that meant we were going for a walk. Again, you will have to play around with it a bit to make sure you have the perfect fit. We also used a lot of treats at first so that he knew this was a good thing.If it is a warm day or we've been walking our dog for a long time, my dog will try to paw it off. At this point, I know he's tired and just wants it off. So I will usually have to take it off towards the end of a long walk. No big deal for me because he's too tired to pull anyway.Also, I'm not so keen on the look of it. Many people see it and think it's a muzzle. I constantly have to explain my dog is not dangerous just a poor walker. He can lick and breathe like normal with it on.Anyway, I recommend this product because it allows us to enjoy our walks together.",dogs
I seen an earlier review about losing the blocks with the other blocks in the house. I personally have always helped put the blocks back into the box they came in. (Which is a challange in itself. And can be great fun also for the child to figure out just how to get them back in the way they came. But I have always gave assistance in doing this. The box is great to keep the cards and blocks together and it's then easy reconizable when looking on the shelves for what you want to grab.)This is a HUGE hit with every small child whom comes to our home. My son has now sort of outgrew them. There isn't such a challange any longer. But I love the idea of the numbered cards. And #1 being the easiest level and then they get more challanging. And it's something I won't be parting with. But pulling out when I have smaller children come visit. It's just to great to get rid of...We're moving up to Time Blocks which is a simular idea of block shapes...With a timer for more of a challange. But I would recommend this to anyone whom wishes to have a great toy that challanges their child's mind.,building toys
"My three year old son loves this puzzle. I love the sturdy pieces and carrying case. The pieces fit together nicely and are the perfect size. The puzzle is a great way for your preschooler to learn to do puzzles, because each picture is individual so you can start by just finding pieces for one vehicle and putting it together. Then move onto the next vehicle and so on. It is challenging without being frustrating.",puzzles

"This product works very well! It is a little tricky programming it, but, just stick with it. The cons are 1) they need a larger unit, 2) they should increase the maximum amount of food that can be dispensed (it only allows up to 2 cups), and, 3) if you want to set the feeder to dispense at, say, two different times, you cannot have it dispense different amounts; that is, if you select 2 cups at 10 a.m., you cannot select 1-1/2 cups at 6 p.m., both have to be the same. Worth the investment to be sure your pet is fed in a timely manner when you're not home.",cats
I am trying to follow an organic and gluten free diet. I also like to buy from reputable companies. So it is hard to find products that meet my criteria.

I tried to return it but I was informed it is not an item you can return which has me a bit upset as it costs over $15 and is inedible. When I opened the first package I was assailed with the smell of rancid oil and so I will not be feeding these organic snacks to my children.The date on the items is not past due, so I assume it is a mistake by the manufacturer. I have ordered other of the Robert's snacks in the past and have never had this problem before, but I will be very hesitant to order any more in the future.",snack food

Unlike the one I returned, this is clearly designed by someone who understands that even pets want to be comfortable. It is very well made, incredibly easy to assemble, and installs in seconds, securely on a seat. It is very apparent that my dog, a chihuahua/miniature pinscher mix, is comfortable and feels secure. After initially looking around she quickly curls into the soft, quilted liner (which is removable and washable) and falls asleep. I very rarely write reviews but was motivated by the quality of this product. You will not be disappointed by this attractive seat.",dogs

"We used the Super Enormous 9' Tunnel for a youth activity [Halloween] event (with over 30 teenagers present). Although somewhat expensive, buying more than one tunnel is highly recommended as the tunnels attach securely and easily together with velcro and increase the fun time. We joined several tunnels together to creat different passage ways within a maze. The tunnels are very functional and durable. Adults as well as kids can easily fit and crawl through this tunnel without fear of ripping the fabric. The padding over the wires is sufficient to prevent discomfort to the knees (at least no more than would otherwise result from crawling around).",sports outdoor play

When I was on Atkins diet a few years ago, most symptoms went away, but that diet is very hard to stick with. When trying to get back to some normalcy in my diet, then the yeast infections came back. I found ThreeLac two years ago and it has greatly reduced the number of yeast infections I have.

"The cats liked it, the water went away much faster when I used this than with their previous water dish. I am not sure if they were drinking more or if it just evaporated faster. I do like the machine, but replacement filters aren't really available locally to me, and wind up being pricey online. Cleaning, which has to be done at least weekly, is a hassle as there are a lot of little hidden crevices to clean. Be sure you have a small cleaning brush if you get this. The noise didn't really bother me, sounded like a fountain, or like a cat drinking. Just all the time.EDIT",cats

"We have found this product very useful for a two cat household. It has done what it was supposed to do but did finally die. We went and bought the newer model (Litermaid Elite LME 9000) and found it to be a piece of JUNK! First it would not fit in the housing that the old model fit. Second, it only removed about half of the waste, leaving the rest behind the comb and had to be cleaned out manually and would pile up in just two days and trap the comb to make it completely un-operative. We found deaf ears at Littermaid. Then the wheels on the traveling comb broke and Littermaid did send out a new comb unit but by then I had had it and had ordered this basic Model LM900.This model is a dream and does what it is supposed to do even better than our older original unit. This is a great example of leave well enough alone as the Elite unit is JUNK!",cats

"Gorilla Munch has been a real life-saver for me. Having celiac disease, I have gotten used to cereals that taste and feel like soggy cardboard. Gorilla Munch is extra crunchy, which in and of itself is like a treat, and it keeps its flavor even when milk is added, which almost never happens with gluten-free cereals. It's more affordably priced than the other gluten-free cereals on the market and is very filling, at least for me. I usually mix in a teaspoon of FiberSure to help make it a little more nutritional, and sometimes I add fresh fruit, which goes very well with it. For those who do not like the crunchiness of Gorilla Munch, I've found that using unsweetened almond milk rather than cow's milk seems to soften it up almost instantly, for some reason.I take issue with the idea that Gorilla Munch is nothing but junk being targeted at children. This cereal is marketed to children who cannot eat gluten, meaning they're mostly children who are used to food tasting terrible (those with celiac disease or wheat allergies) and children who are /positively/ stimulated by bright colors and designs (those with autism). They are already on strict diets which require that they watch their nutrient intake, so having one mostly fluff product is not going to hurt them. Children on gluten-free diets aren't exactly the ones you worry about eating doughnuts and cookies every day, and with all of the bland, soggy food we're stuck with, they deserve a treat once in a while. And with almost no other brand making fun-looking gluten-free items geared at children, it's good to have at least /something/ to look at, especially something that's educational.Additionally, EnviroKidz is a great company to support. They spread awareness about important environmental and animal rights issues through their products, they use only environment-friendly organic products, and they give 1% of their proceeds to related causes. When I have called their customer service line in the past, they have been exceptionally helpful, once even giving me a full refund for a product that was only slightly damaged. I would much rather give them my money than some of the other lines out there.In brief, Gorilla Munch is a great cereal that helps put some life back into a gluten-free diet. It's nice to be able to eat a bowl of cereal again and not have to be reminded of my special diet and how restrictive it can be. Thank you, Gorilla Munch!",breakfast foods

"I give this litter box 3 stars because it's made well and looks great. My cat would pee in it, but not poop in it. He would cry....then go on my comforter.He never figured out how to stand on it. Always went backwards or sideways.The manufacturer has a great website with many videos of cats doing their business on it. I think it just depends on the cat.I just think that trying to force a cat to do his business within a 8"" x 5"" oval is just too stressful for them. Plus, if your cat likes to diligently cover up his business when he's done, he won't like this. Mine would step down and try to reach into the hole to cover up his pee, but couldnt really get the job done. He was confused and tried and tried.By the way, this entire box is the size of your own toilet lid! It's quite compact and snazzy looking. I really think it would be absolutely PERFECT to train a kitten on this. The kitten would be small, and wouldnt mind the small area to use. But trying to get my 1 year old to ""downsize"" just wouldnt work.The actual area to put litter was about 12"" x 10"". So you will use very little litter. I'm thinking it's a must to use clumping litter with this box, though, because the ""pan"" part is so small, theres no room for scraping and foraging without getting litter everywhere. Scoopable litter would be easy to scoop out the clumps though.Give it a try if you have a kitten. Didn't work for my young adult cat.",cats

It only shoots one dart at a time before you have to reload it, but it is quite easy to reload.This is a great Nerf Gun packages bu just saying again I really don't like the Nerf Hornet, and the Nerf Scout is truly amazing.",sports outdoor play

"This is a great system at a great value. My personal experience with it is still evolving as my dog (a 7 yr old, stubborn boxer) is still in training. Super easy to install, took less than a day to completely set it up. Training info was explained well and overall I am happy with my purchase. My dog has crossed the boundaries a few times, but I attribute that to her stubborn and also forgetful disposition. She is definitely aware of the safezone and steers clear of the training flags. I am confident that with further reinforcement and time she will be fine. Definitely worth a try!",dogs

"I am currently on my second container of Gaspari's SuperPump 250. I have tried NO Xplode, a similar Nitric Oxide product.With the NO Xplode I got decent pumps and excellent focus for about the first two weeks. After time I grew more and more tolerant, to the point where 2.5 scoops was barely noticeable.I decided to switch to SuperPump, mainly because it was $15 cheaper. I'm so glad that I did. I currently take 2 heaping scoops of SuperPump with a half tsp. of creatine ethyl ester before every workout. In 20-30 minutes my head is rushing, my muscles are pumping, and I have an incredible feeling of focus and energy. I can work out harder, my muscles get incredibly pumped, and my veins grow more distinguishable. SuperPump also helps to burn fat. The best part is that the effects of SuperPump last for about 2 hours, and I still get the same if not more effect as I did on the very first day.Side Effects:-Smelly Gas every now and then-Change in stool consistency.-Drowsiness after wearing off (if you take too late at night)-Light Headedness (if you are dehydrated)Before using SuperPump there are a few things you should know.-I've only tried Blue Raspberry. It's an acquired taste but it is definitely manageable. No gagging like I did with NO-Xplode Lemon Lime-Take it on an empty stomach and don't eat or drink anything but water for at least 20 minutes after taking! Otherwise your SuperPump may turn into SuperPoop.-This is not for the casual gym goer. This is for regular, explosive workouts to put on lean muscle.-Not good for aerobic workouts. I've tried it and I feel like my muscles get too pumped. It hinders range of motion a bit and I get slightly queasy.-Start small. One scoop the first couple times. Once you get used to it up to 1.5 scoops. Then go to 2. Then if you really want to get pumped go for 2 heaping or 2.5 I have felt no need to go with 3.-It says on the package to take on off days. Don't. It's a waste of money.-Drink lots of water!-I'd recommend cycling. I do 3 months on and 1 month off, in conjunction with my creatine.If you follow those tips you should minimize side effects and get fantastic results. I will never go back to a different Nitrogen product.",nutrition wellness
"...from Melissa & Doug.Beyond the obvious shape, color & object learning, this toy is just plain fun! I'm a fan of wooden toys; the less toxic plastic in my world the better.My preschooler son enjoys this one a great deal & will get it out on his own, dumping it all over the floor. The puzzles are two-sided & along with the shape pieces, stored in it's own compartmented box. I wish it came with a lid, either sliding or flap, but not having a lid does make it easier for my son to see what's inside.The only downside, is the many pieces to pick up, but you can make it a fun game with your child by asking him or her to pick up first by color, then by shape, etc.There are points of course on the angular pieces, but with some supervision no one should get hurt. Hey, your child can get hurt walking...so far, no one's gotten poked, pricked or banged except when my son throws the pieces around, as he does with everything.A good puzzle set for the toddler in your life.UPDATE...almost 2 years on & the paint has held up, the wood has held up, all in all so far fairly durable.

"I can say that this AKC squirrel instantly became my dog's favorite toy the second she saw it. The squirrel is exceptionally realistic looking, especially from a distance. I set the toy out on the lawn and the dog, already an avid squirrel chaser, took off after it like a bullet. It is the only squirrel she has ever been able to catch! She immediately took it and ran with it into the house and jumped up on the bed to chew on it (which I suppose is a preview of coming attractions should she ever happen to catch a real one). I have tried to get her to play with her other toys, but if the squirrel is anywhere in sight, she won't even look at the others. If the squirrel is anywhere she can get to it, she will grab it and go jump up on the bed to gnaw on it. If the squirrel is out of reach, and she can see it, she will stare at the squirrel, then look at me, then stare at the squirrel, then look at me, until I can't stand it any more and either give it to her or hide it. So why only 3 stars? Unfortunately, the squirrel is a bit fragile for my particular dog. Some reviewers have said that their dog has had this toy for months or years. From that I can surmise that their dog is not a Norrbottenspets. Norrbottenspets are a 'primitive' breed with strong instincts for chasing, catching and gutting small ground animals. It is not surprising that this same fate would be in store for stuffed toys that resemble small ground animals. The squeaker in the tail didn't last 5 minutes before it was pierced by a sharp canine tooth. Next were the feet. I left the room for 10 minutes to take a phone call, and when I returned the squirrel was footless and stuffing was decorating the bed. So I put the toy away and, to make it last a bit longer, I have tried to let her have it only when supervised. However, even that is tricky. She is very good at holding it in her paws and hiding what she is actually doing to it, such as chewing its legs off. And I can't watch her every second. The squirrel lost two legs during a recent bathroom break. So after a week, we are down to a squirrel with only the vestige of one leg remaining, and a tail chewed just about in half. Lately I can see that she has turned her attention to its head. The ears were the first thing to go once that happened. I fully expect that before the month is out, the squirrel will be headless as well. Then it will join company with the five other stuffed animal torsos currently in the sewing room awaiting surgery. So, while this is a great toy, and dogs love it, if you have a toy-shredder like I do, it may not be the best choice for you. It's a bit pricey as a ""sacrificial"" toy. I can buy similar sized stuffed toys at Pet Club for a couple of bucks, that I don't feel bad about just throwing away once they become a legless, decapitated torso. I found a small stuffed toy dog there (at least I think it started out as a dog) that was constructed in a way that the legs and ears could be chewed off without getting into the body cavity, and the head and torso are basically one piece. So, while it, too, has been reduced to a legless, earless head/torso, the squeaker still works and the what is left of it is not leaking any stuffing. That one has gone a few months and is still hanging in there (although you can't tell what it used to be. It looks like a fuzzy cylinder). It only cost $3.97.",dogs

My child had fun making the artwork and we are having it sent to grandma. For the price I paid I have don't have a problem paying an extra small processing fee.

"My sister ordered this for my 11 year old daughter. We promptly ordered the larvae with the understanding that they would not mail them until the weather conditions were agreeable. We ordered them in Texas in August so when we didn't get them for a couple of months, we thought it was still too hot. Finally about 4 months after we ordered the larvae (and had received nothing), I called the company. Firstly, they acted like I was crazy for not having called them sooner and/or was lying about it. They asked for proof of purchase. I said I had our half of the postcard that we used to order the larvae. They asked that I fax a copy of this to them. (Still felt like they thought I was trying to pull some scam!!) We then received a mailing tube of what appeared to be dead larvae. We went ahead and followed all directions to the letter. Nothing ever moved, lived or developed at all. I faxed a copy of the original card again telling them that everything was dead when received and/or died in transit. That was at least 6 months ago and they never even responded. Don't waste your money on this. Sadly, the company is not at all interested in the children that are disappointed. Every time I look at that empty habitat (kinda cute actually), I'm furious at a company that doesn't care that my 11 year old (now 12) got a useless gift that should have been a good gift!

The paint cups are great because they don't spill and do wipe off some of the excess paint. The paper roll is surprisingly easy to use, changing paper between masterpieces takes less than 30 seconds. The chalk board works great and is easy to clean. I read other reviews about chalkboard problems. They must have fixed this because my chalkboard came out of the box ready to use, no priming instructions and no problems with scratching or faint chalk.

There are two little hooks on the front of the arrow that need to be hooked around the front strings. There is also a groove on the back of the arrow that needs to sit on the rear string. It took about a minute to explain this to him. I left him alone to fiddle with it for a while. Then I made suggestions like his hand needs to be behind the rear string, not in front of it. It took him less than ten minutes to get the hang of it. In no time at all he was shooting down towers of paper cups. He loves and plays with this every day!

Within minutes Ben and his siblings were fascinated by checking out paper with print on it, hair, an onion peel, and more. My only suggestion might be to include more by way of prepared slides. However, it is also good for them to make their own and have their own ideas, too. Plus, the price was an absolutely fantastic value.",learning education

In an age of video games and 24 hour cartoons, it is a huge releif to find something the kids can do inside that keeps them moving and not out of control. The only down side of this one is that it was misshaped. The 22"" hopper was fine, but the 18"" looked like it was warped. I don't think my kids have noticed and it doesn't affect the way it works. Purely cosmetic. I highly, highly highly recommend this hopper.",sports outdoor play

"For the past 20 years, I've had planted aquariums, ranging from 10 gal to 50 gal. In the past, I tried hang-on filters, canister filters, etc, and annoyed with all the noise and the extra work they seem to create, I started using Fluval internal filters years ago and love them.A planted tank's CO2 levels (needed for good plant growth)can easily be depleted with filters that agitate the surface water. I have Fluval 1s up to the Fluval Plus 4 in all my tanks. If you have lots of plants and not many fish, these are great filters. They are extremely quiet and reliable. My big tank is in my guest room, and my guests don't notice the filter noise. Being in the country, my electricity goes out frequently for short periods of time -- the filters start up just fine once it goes back on and I have never lost any fish.Since I have a light fish waste load, I only need to clean the filters about 4-6 times a year, using water pulled from the aquarium so I don't damage the biological bacteria. I pack my filters with foam and bio balls, and if necessary for a short time to polish the water after moving plants, I use a poly pad. Used in the right circumstances (i.e. light to medium fish waste and filtering needs), these filters are hard to beat.",fish aquatic pets

"I needed a nail kit to take care of my Mother's nails. She is aging and is becoming unable to take care of her own nails. I don't trust myself to use nippers and such on another person. After looking at a number of nail kits, I chose this one based on price, tools included, size and portablility (I liked that it was battery and I could use it anywhere.) I am very pleased with my purchase. It arrived quickly and does exactly what I needed it to do. It has plenty of power and we did her nails in no time and they looked really good. It's not a sexy little nail spa, but it is a perfect little nail kit. Now I'm going to get one for myself.2-21-13 UpdateI am still using this original unit for my Mother's nail care and the second one that I bought for myself. I read some of the reviews about the power and I would say that the unit is designed to stop if you press too hard against the nail. It may take a little longer, but if you let the tool do the work it will limit the risk of burning yourself or someone else. I appreciate this feature, because I use it on another person. I follow the 3 second rule on my Mother and keep the tool moving, so I don't burn her. Also, it will slow down or stop more easily when the batteries need changing. With regular use of this kit we have returned her nails to healthy. I have used this kit once a month since my original review in 2008. It still works well and the tools have not worn down. When something does happen to this little kit, if it's still available I will buy another one.",medical supplies equipment

If you forget to turn the collar off, you'll be faced with dead batteries in a short time.This is unacceptable because the collar unit, while not even being used to administer the slight electrical shock, runs down the battery quite quickly by just being on.The unit failed to function in less than a year.

I tried it on myself to see how well it works.. no surprise, it doesn't. It has crappy construction and is very inconsistent. You do hear amplified sound from your surroundings but in a muffled kind of way (kind of like when you plug your ears and hear yourself talk). The volume dial doesn't always work, sometimes it turns volume up, but other times nothing happens. Occasionally meddling with the dial produces a sharp, high pitch sound which cannot be good for your hearing. This looks more like a toy than a real hearing aid, but what do you expect at this price. Still I didn't expect the product to be harmful to your ears. Even with a refund, I'm still out the s/h fee. This stuff can be hazardous and should really be banned!",medical supplies equipment

Best part? I get a good 2-3 hours of feeling full on a consumption of only 170 calories. I guess we'll see, but I have a feeling that I'll really grow to love them over time. That's my beef with a lot of these diet products...they don't have to ""taste great"", but if you can make them nice and mild like this particular flavor, they go down easy and get the job done.

They are also made with organic ingredients, and they are made especially for the nutritional needs of women. The S'mores flavor has a great, rich chocolate topping/coating and it seems that sometimes they have a hint of coconut flavor(that could be my imagination), which reminds me of a macaroon cookie or an Almond Joy bar. They don't taste much like an actual s'more like you'd have around the campfire, though.The only reason I didn't give them a 5-star rating is that the bars are quite high in carbohydrates and don't have as much protein as I'd like. However, if you are looking for a snack or something to control those cravings, these are a far superior option to candy or cookies, they're nutritious, have less than 200 calories/bar, satisfy, and they do taste good.",nutrition wellness

Even taking into account that they are designed to be lower in refined sugar and higher in fiber, they are still quite bland and could use more sweetness. In no way do they taste even close to a candy bar like other protein bars can. I am a major connoisseur of the lower-sugar, lower-calorie, higher-fiber protein bars, and I have to say that Zoe's bars rank last in my opinion.

"Like any fully conscious person with a conscience, I have concerns about my health, my body, and the health of the environment. So, the thought of responsibly grown 100% cotton, bleached with a method free of dioxin as a byproduct, was definitely appealing. I swallowed the extra expense, thinking these just had to be better. Well, sadly, I found the absorbency a bit lacking, and I do NOT have a heavy flow. It was irritating that the tampons would begin leaking, forcing me to change them only to find they weren't completely saturated. All of the frequent changes irritated me setting off a chain of yeast infections. You might not like reading this review, if you were interested in purchasing Natracare; but I must tell you all hope is NOT lost! There really is a better way! If you really care about your health, and the health of the environment, try a Diva cup. It's truly everything that these tampons were not, and them some. You might think you have to make some sort of sacrifice to help the environment, but I will tell you reusable menstrual cups are not only more responsible, but also more convenient for you. Why pay someone in a foreign country to break their back raising organic cotton so you can pay a fortune for the priveledge of bleeding all over it and then send it to the landfill where it will take who knows how long to break down? In posting this review I'm only trying to help someone who shares my concerns about tampon safety, and who might not otherwise hear about menstrual cups for several more years, if ever in their lives. The only way I found out about them, you see, is because another tampon reviewer mentioned it in her review, and I'm thankful she did. It has changed my life for the better. BTW, Amazon also sells Diva cups. Read the reviews.",nutrition wellness

"My 6 yr. old twins were very excited to receive this for their birthday and get to decorate their room. It was a great tool to use to have a discussion about the planets as we blew them up. (Which took about 1/2 hr using the included foot pump). I appreciated the included booklet for additional information about the planets, but only wish it was a little bit more kid friendly. After we took time to blow them up and then hang them, it was only a few hours later that three of them lost air. Needless to say, despite the fact that they come with patches for fixing them, I wasn't happy to have to do this just after receiving them.

In addition, the dates are a good source of Vitamins A, C, and B-Complex, plus iron and and magnesium as well.

"I bought this watch for myself and really wanted to love it. My old talking watch died on me and I needed a quick, economical replacement for it. This one seemed to meet those criteria. Sadly, it didn't live up to my expectations. After less than 2 months, it just plain quit working right.There ARE good points about this watch. There are 4 diferent alarms to set for time reminders. I loved that. It woke me up, alerted me to it being time to get the kids off to school, told me when they would be home soon and let me know when it was time to start getting them ready for bed. I loved the stopwatch feature. I was really in love with the date function. In so many ways, it was everything I wanted. And then there were flaws...I loathed the watch band. Looking at the picture, it appeared to be your typical rubbery plastic sport-type band. But it wasn't. It's a stiff plastic that really made it a pain in the backside to buckle on my wrist. And then there's the fact that it's lasted me a mere 6 weeks before dying on me. I turned off the hourly report feature one nite. 45 minutes later, when I went to check the time, it didn't respond. It was totally blank. Ticked off, I set it aside and looked at it the next morning. It was once again showing time (the incorrect time), but the buttons wouldn't do anything. No talking. No resetting the time. Nothing. I've never gotten it wet. It's been taken care of. And it just died.Now, perhaps I got a bad one. One of the parts in it just fizzled out. But when you're visually impaired and your watch dies, you're kinda up the creek without a paddle, so to speak. If I were you, I would buy a totally different watch. If you want something cheap? Independent Living Aids sells a REALLY cheap talking watch for around $7. It's ugly to look at, but will do the job if you need that. Or you can spend around double and buy something that looks a whole lite nicer and much better quality to last a lot longer.",medical supplies equipment

"The XP3 is a very good canister filter.The good? 3 decent sized trays, ""priming"" intake tube, configurable outflow tubes, all-you-need-in-a-box package (with exception of biomedia).The bad? The quick disconnect is not heavy duty and can be distorted by any tension on one of the tubes (especially the output)--resulting in a leak because the O-rings do not seat. Also, the o-ring are not a ""tight"" fit and cannot handle much pressure. If you have any inline accessories that constitute a significant load (ie. uv sterilizers, CO2 reactors, etc), water will leak past the disconnect o-rings and onto your floor after flooding the top unit on the inside!

Excellent item and price is good. Nearly silent operation and the AHA triple sample is surprisingly effective in being able to see how your BP varies.

With this walker they've improved on the break handles, they added plastic protectors over the bars that support the basket and the seat (provides protection for the bars and the one on the basket keeps the basket in place better when folding and unfolding for transportation), the wheels were also redesigned so they function very smoothly.Whenever I've had questions, Medline has been very helpful in getting me answers.If you're looking for a rolling walker, I would highly recommend this one.",medical supplies equipment

"I haven't used anything but this and Planet in a long time, and what I used previously I don't remember well enough to compare, but...Using the same amount of this cleans a lot better than Planet. At least for guinea pig urine-soaked towels. It actually uses less bedding for a decent sized cage (minimum for one gpig is 7.5 square feet! and since they're social animals, it's actually cruel to keep one alone! and there are so many dying in animal shelters across the country! and so I adopted a bonded trio...and 3 guinea pigs pee a lot) compared to a smaller one, because the bedding stays cleaner, but still, it seemed wasteful to use disposable bedding. I don't mind paying enough money to keep my furkids healthy, and everything I found was sort of expensive (other than pine and cedar shavings, which were out of the question because they are toxic to gpigs and other animals), so I went with CareFresh. Then I realized towels with fleece are cheaper in the long run and just as healthy and comfortable, if not more.The problem with fleece is that although it wicks to keep the occupants dry, it can hide the dirtiness of the towels, so sometimes I am lazy and don't wash them often enough. This results in some horrible towels. Although they got clean again in the washing machine using Planet, a lot of stains stayed. I was surprised at the difference this detergent made, getting out most of the stains without any help from other cleaners. I will probably never go back to Planet, at least for my babies' towels.Another event that impressed me was when my best friend despaired because I borrowed his light grey tshirt and spilled bright red cough syrup on it. After an application of Nature's Miracle and a cold rinse, a lot of the staining was still visible. I rubbed some of this detergent into the stains, let it sit a while, then put it through one cycle. No more stains!Of course it's very important to me that this detergent is safe to use, especially for delicate skin and respiratory systems. I refuse to buy any detergent tested on animals or made with animal products, and it's great that this detergent is environmentally friendly too, reducing harm to wildlife as well as humans and their captive animals.",household supplies

After using this deodorant for about a month now I am amazed at the longevity of Lavilin in stopping odor. One particular application lasted for over 5 days and could probably have lasted longer. I am a person who used regular deodorant and had to apply maybe two to three times per day. Another one of my concerns was not getting yet another synthetically chemical infested deodorant. I have terrible allergic reactions to the dyes and what not in normal products. This was really a lifesaver for me. The only real qualm I have with the product is the price per ounce. It comes in at over $20 per ounce (that is more than the price of silver) and you only get 0.44 ounces. Mine only lasted a month without any real strenuous physical activity. And even if it lasts 2 months it would still be double the price of a stick of regular deodorant. My real problem with the deodorant is you can't find it at regular stores. I'm not going to buy a month's worth of deodorant and pay $5 in shipping costs everytime I run out of the miniscule amount that is given.,nutrition wellness

"We got this because we had a bad case of bedbugs. I had done some research and read that the more toxic insecticides were not particularly effective at killing the bugs, so I decided to go with more natural products, at least the first time around.Kleen Free is great for killing the bugs you see. It works really quickly on bedbugs, and a little more slowly on roaches (which we discovered when we thought we saw a bedbug in the kitchen, but it turned out to be a roach).The website for the product claims that you can spray your whole bed, and it will kill the bugs when they emerge. This, sadly, isn't true. But for killing them on contact, it's great. We keep a bottle in the bedroom, and keep a strict watch out for when we see them emerging from the ceiling (are ours the only bedbugs that seem to come from the ceiling? We suspect it's from the upstairs apartment, but they insist they don't want their space treated.)You have to combine this product with something else that will work longer-term (ie, a ""residual kill"" rather than a ""contact kill"" product.) We use C-M Powder Gard for that, and it also works well.What we most like about the Kleen Free products is that they don't make anyone in the house sick. It's safe for us--I've even accidentally gotten a bit of spray in my eyes, and it didn't irritate them (I don't recommend doing that, though!). Given that I have intense chemical sensitivities, this is a major advantage of the product.",household supplies

One night after 4 beers in 2 hours, and the recommended 20 minute waiting period afterwards, I blew a .14. Last weekend at the end of the night I blew a .33 and was not in driving shape, but far from blacked out. My friend that same night (all following the 20 minute delay periods as well) blew a .37. As a 105lb girl I am pretty sure she wasn't anywhere near that considering we were having a conversation and the instruction manual said she should be in a deep coma and at .40 she should be dead.On the other side it is very consistent. I blow, and wait 2 minutes, nearly identical everytime. I guess you just need to know what real number corresponds to what they are telling you.

"I bought these as a way to supplement my meals, as well as get more fiber and protein. First of all, these bars are fairly nutritious. They are made of natural ingredients and whole grains, just like the cereal. Each bar contains 6g of fiber and 9g of protein. Considering most people in the United States don't get enough fiber, that is a very decent amount. Previously I was eating the Fiber One Bars Oats & Chocolate, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6). While you get 3g more fiber in those bars, you only get 2g of Protein. The Kashi bars are made of better (and more nutritious) ingredients, and they taste better as well. Each bar has only 180 calories, but they are very filling due to the fiber and protein.Although a bar made of brown rice and oats doesn't sound very tasty, these are some of the best bars I've tried.

Also because I never was able to keep more than 3 fish alive for any length of time. For the last two years I had two in the tank. Ultimately one of them outgrew the other enough to bully it to death. I did end up giving the bully away but it was too late to save the fish that remained. I never had problems with the motor, though it definitely needs water levels maintained to work effectively. The light does heat up the water and I found even when I left the light out, the water temp was usually at the upper end of the safe zone. Never had any success with goldfish.

The door bracket is far too small to support the amount of traction in a stable fashion. Buyer beware.The device does work very well though. The concerns about too much pressure on the mandible can be taken care of by simply leaning backwards a bit so that the tension is shifted to the back of the head (occipital region).I will stick with the device but need to modify it by adding steel plates to the bracket enlarging its contact surface area with the door.

"We got this for Christmas in 2006, then found ants to put in it in summer 2007. They lived, but did NOTHING for the entire few months they lived...although we did enjoy seeing them eat the random spider we'd through in there. :) These were tiny little ants that that were so small we had to put a piece of tape over the air holes because they could crawl through! Two days ago we went out in our woods and found a log with the larger ants living in it. After some creative work on my part with a jar and kids 1"" paint brush, I was able to catch some of those. (wait for a sunny day when they are near the surface of their hole) They are already digging and tunneling! We even got some larvae that we hope to see develop! We spent the time during the school year studying ants as a homeschool project, so we were disappointed when the first batch didn't do anything, but now that we have studied them so extensively, we are thrilled to see them build their nurseries, garbage dump, sleeping quarters, etc. Can't wait to see if any males emerge from the larvae! We'll release those if they do!Oh..and very tricky for me to get the ants INTO the farm. After collecting them in a jar, I found a way to separate them from the debris, then put a paper cover on the jar that left a 1-2"" oval opening/pour spout area. I took the cover off the farm and lightly taped a piece of paper the same size as the lid to the top, then poked a hole with a pencil about the size of my funnel that I have. I then poured the ants into the funnel and used the paintbrush to help get them in there and down the funnel. Once in the farm, I sifted through the previously separated debris on a piece of paper to find the larvae, then dumped them down the funnel. When the funnel was not in the hole, I put a small piece of tape over the hole. After everyone was in safe and sound, I waited for them to settle down, then quickly and gently removed the paper and replaced the lid. There has got to be an easier way to do this, but this is what we figured out and I thought I'd post it here in case someone finds themselves stuck in the same place we were with...how do we get these into the farm and not all over the counter or porch?",learning education

The item does a fair job, BUT the connection between the to parts is a very weak plastic and does not have enough length to adequately support the joint. If you lift anything the connection is under strain and bends. In order to use the tool, I securely wrapped it with duct tape for support and do not lift anything heavier than my shoe. It does do a fair job of pulling the straps over to fasten, however the lower jaw frequently slips off to the side the upper and jams.",medical supplies equipment

"This unit is a two person setup; it works well to keep track of a 30 test average. It does not allow you to review each individual reading of the 30 test average; you must keep a written log if you need that, or if you want to see an am versus pm reading. It appears to be accurate when the cuff is applied properly; at first I was putting it on to loosely causing a elevated diastolic pressure reading, but when tightened a little more my reading was accurate. Monitoring your blood pressure can motivate you to make changes in life style and help you to change bad habits. Through monitoring, deep breathing, relaxation, diet and exercise, I have been able to lower my cholesterol and my blood pressure and at 59 no longer take any medication at all.

"Over the last few years I have become increasingly concerned about my impact on the environment. I use compact fluorescent light bulbs, recycle at least half my trash, try not to drive very much, and buy eco-friendly products. This is one of the products I have purchased to replaceCascade Complete Gel Lemon Burst - 45 Oz, 12 Eawhich I had been using for the last 15 years. I really assumed this would be an equal, or close to equal, trade considering the higher price... no such luck, unfortunately.I found that this cleaner left food stains on the dishes and silverware, which I normally was able to clean with Cascade. I also found that harsher stains such as coffee rings in mugs were left untouched after even two washes. I have recently started pre-scrubbing all the dishes and the silverware before washing. This resolves almost all of the problems, but at a cost. If you were unable to scrub dishes, due to arthritis or didn't have time due to a busy schedule, then this would be really annoying. Plus for those of us that use multiple washes to counter the ineffectiveness, the impact on the environment may be neutralized since we would be wasting more water, more electricity, more gel, etc. If you have a high efficiency dishwasher and don't mind supplying some essential elbow grease, then I would say this product does help the environment and can eventually clean your dishes. On the other hand if you are looking for a great automatic dishwasher gel, then keep looking. This product ranks similar to the cheapest watered-down generics lurking in the sale aisle of a dollar store. Nothing against this product's intentions, I commend them.

"I've been using these in my home for several years now. My wife used to insist on throwing those bleach disk things into the tanks of all our toilets, which caused me to have to replace the flapper valves at least once a year as they got brittle and stiff in the continuous presence of oxidizer in the tank water. I was quite happy when I found this cleaning system at a local store as an alternative. The bleach is added to the water that is sprayed into the standpipe and ends up in the bowl; none of it goes into the tank to ruin the valve, flapper, or other parts.Installation was very simple. You don't even have to shut off the water supply. I did six of them in less than an hour altogether. Replacing the cartridges is simple.I was afraid the cartridges wouldn't last very long, given the number of users in our house (and a number of them small children who tend to use the toilet more often), but even if our highest-use toilet they seem to last three to four months. On our lower-use toilets, I get the blue ones so I can tell when they're running out. The high-use ones gets the bleach cartridges and I just replace them every three months or so. Occasionally I get in to replace one and find it still has a fair bit of material left in it; I just leave those for another month or so until it is all gone, or nearly so.My wife likes these almost as much as I do; she thinks this system works better than the disks you drop in the tank (which makes sense; the cleaner/bleach is concentrated in the bowl where it's needed, not sitting in the tank where some of it will pass through the bowl but most of it will go right down the drain), so we're both happy.",household supplies

"OMRON HEM-790 IT BP UNIT REVIEWI bought OMRON HEM-790 IT to replace a 12 year old Sunbeam-Oster 7622 BP unit which never worked properly and gave erratic reading. Highly skeptical that consumer level BP monitoring can actually work, I took CR (Consumer Report) recommendation, and bought an OMRON unit equipped with IntelliSense technology. The major concern of the purchase was the unit's accuracy, and thus the thrust of this report is to give a qualitative description of measurement methodology and a quantitative approximation of its accuracy.The unit comes with AC adaptor, batteries and ComFit pressure cuff, software and usb cable. After connecting the cuff hose and the AC adaptor to the unit then quickly setting the date & time, the unit is ready for measurement! The unit pumps up the cuff with a small internal motor, about 10 mmHg per second to about 20 to 40 mmHg above the systolic value. Then it deflates, at about the same rate, giving a pressure reading of the cuff about one a second. The whole inflation and deflation process takes about half a minute; too fast to use a stethoscope and read off the values while listening for the Korotkoff (turbulence) sound. At the end of the measurement, the unit will display the systolic and diastolic values on a huge display, and store those values in the memory so that eventually it can be downloaded to a pc and plotted. One hundred readings can be stored for user A, and another hundred for user B, so the unit can accommodate two regular users, and unlimited guests (their readings not stored in memory). Taking more than 100 readings will overwrite the oldest stored data in the memory, therefore it is recommended to download the data regularly (every month or so).To download the data, the unit is connected to a USB port in a similar fashion to a digital camera. Unlike a digital camera, however, you cannot see the BP monitor as a drive; but you can simply download its data and plot it with the software that came with it. The data can also be exported into a CSV file, which Excel or JMP can read. The headers of the download are the systolic and diastolic pressures, pulse, and heart beats irregularity numbers. Each measurement will be a line in this table. The software is not the highlight of the unit but adequate.The unit uses the oscillometric method to measure blood pressure. In the oscillometric method, a cuff is inflated until the blood flow is completely cut off, then the cuff is slowly deflated. As the blood starts to flow during the partial restriction of the arteries, and then without restriction, the transducer connected to the cuff hose measures the oscillating pressure of the cuff. The unit computes the values for systolic and diastolic blood pressure from the pressure oscillations using a fit algorithm rather than from listening for the Korotkoff sound used in the auscoltatory method. The fit values are determined so that measurements match that of auscoltatory method, which is considered the golden standard. (The auscoltatory method uses a mercury column to measure the pressure of the cuff, and a stethoscope is used to listen to the Korotkoff sound as the blood flow goes from completely restricted to unrestricted.) Oscillometric methods may produce inaccurate reading for a variety of reasons such as for circulatory problems.To assess the unit accuracy for repeatability, I took 30 consecutive measurements in groups of three. There was a rest time of 2 min between the groups and also the cuff was adjusted between the groups. There was a 30 sec rest time between each measurement within a group. I took the average of the 30 measurements for the systolic and then for the diastolic to be the true systolic and diastolic BP value; the deviation of each measurement from this average to be the repeatability error. The first observation was that the error did not have a trend, thus the BP measurement itself did not change the actual BP of the patient. Second, the errors were similar in groups of three, suggesting that the large part of the error was due to the position of the cuff. I found the largest deviation from the mean to be +-12 Hgmm for the systolic and +-7 mmHg for the diastolic, while majority of the error data was +-10 mmHg for the systolic and +-4mmHg for the diastolic . This error could be reduced to 2/3 of that, using the TruRead setting, which basically means that the unit takes three subsequent measurements and averages them out. The error could be further reduced by adjusting the cuff between each of the three measurements. In the language of statistics, I found that the one sigma repeatability error of the unit to be about 4 to 5 % for both systolic and diastolic values which can be reduced to 3 to 4% using TruRead.I am speculating, that there is a cuff error regardless of measurement methodology, simply because depending on how a cuff is wrapped, it may need different amount of pressure just to conform it to the arm, before it can exert any pressure on the arm.Significantly, the unit zeros itself at the start of each measurement, thus a rainy weather is not going to reduce BP readings, and conversely, the sunny weather is not going to raise it. The reading at Denver should also be the same as one at Half Moon Bay. I do not know if the PB of an individual is influenced by air pressure, but the reading should not be.I also found that BP measurements, taken in a half an hour time frame at a doctor's office and later by this unit were within 9 mmHg. However, the measurement at the doctor's office were also taken with the oscillometric method, therefore I do not know with certainty where to assign this measurement discrepancy.Based on this limited set of data, one unit, one size arm, one set of measurement, this unit seems to be a decent one that produced a fairly accurate reading. It can definitely resolve the regions of normal BP, borderline BP and various levels of high BP. It is light years ahead of similar PB measurement units produced in years past. It is true, that physicians have capability for a more accurate BP reading (if they take advantage of it) but they have access to far fewer readings. The unit's strength is that it can collect lots of BP readings, so statistics can compensate for the lack of absolute accuracy. From data collected on a regular bases, one might find trends that a physician might otherwise miss.I do not have long term reliability / drift data on the unit, but it does come with a 5 year warranty. Based on this information and the unit's affordability, I would recommend this unit.",medical supplies equipment

"I was skeptical when I ordered this toy. I'd seen it advertised, and it struck me as just another toy to play annoying songs. I actually try to avoid battery-powered toys as much as possible. However, I wanted a toy that my 10 month old son could play with in the kitchen while I cook/clean/etc.The stage came today, and as is written in the amazon description/editorial off the toy, the legs are a pain to put on, mainly because I couldn't get the screws to go all the way in. I am satisfied, however, that they are in good enough for the toy to be sturdy and not a hazard of any sort.After I put the toy together, I let my son have a go at it, and oh my gosh, he was in heaven. The voice that scat sings is the voice of a child, and while it isn't necessarily music to my ears, my little boy laughed his head off. He loves the mirror and the lights. He loves the music. He preferred the mode where he can hit and make the sounds rather than the songs just playing for him. And that was fine by me because I was able to clean the kitchen up while he laughed and played. I even stopped what I was doing to grab the video camera because he was having such a big time. Even more importantly, I put him down late for his nap because he was having such a big time. Trust me, I am schedule-bound, so a late nap is huge.The only critique I have of the toy (other than the previously mentioned leg attachment issue) is that I wish the feet had some sort of non-sliding surface.

"This is an exellent buy if this is your first brass spyglass. For being so sheap this sure is good quality, every part of it is verry accurate. I really do have seen a lot worse. People who do not CARE to examine and learn for themselves OR are not used to handle and use spyglasses may have some problem getting the focus right. In any case the focus is really sharp when you do get it right.You need to twist the smallest tube to change the focus depth. Pracise make perfect!Even thou its not verry big in size i found that it was as ""big"" and heavy as i would tolerate for easy carrying and easy use in a larp. You may carry it in a small beltbag, and it fits nicely in your palm.The only bad thing about it was the fake-leather. I bought it to use on a Pirate LARP (Live Action Role Playing) and i had to remove the plastic ""leather"" and sew on a new real piece of darkbrown leather myself.Besides this, modern brass items are often lacquerd with a special clear brass protective lacquer, witch makes it impossible to corrode. I wandted that antique feeling since im using it on larps. So in order to get that old look to it I took everything apart (total disensembling), and polished off the lacquer using a grinding machine with a verry fine polishing rondell, and reassembled it. Afer two months it looked like a movie prop, corroded (darkened) and beautiful.However I do not recommend anyone to do this UNLESS you are a craftsman who knows how to work metals and have basic (proffessional) polishing skills. If you are going to do this anyway, be extra careful to remove the glass parts so that you dont accidentally polish them! And be careful not to grind away any metal or you may destroy it completley.There are more than five, exactly the same, spyglasses here on Amazon.com they look exactly the same and comes with the same fake-leather carrying case. So im leaving this rating on a fiew of them. They are all manufactured in the same place, probably china, and distributed to the different vendors.I hope my rewiew was any help to you!Have a Good Larp!:D",learning education

The cheap housing however is a major deterrent from this product and justifies the lower price compared to two other loupes which I mention at the end.Pros:Provided is 5x, 7x and 9x magnification by 3 individual lens. The lens work great individually and at 21mm diameter, it is nice to have a viewing area of that size. The lens also work very well in combination to increase the magnification 5x all the way to 20x.Cons:The housing is tough but made of plastic. The lens holders are also made of light plastic.

And they are right in there in many of the so-called healthy alternative detergents!One company, Seventh Generation, uses flowery, eco-obfuscating language; they never tell you that their product actually contains sodium laureth sulfate (similar in structure to sulfuric acid), the cheapest of sudsing agents, which is found in almost all ""mainstream"" personal care items; dish detergent, body wash, shampoo, etc.When I went to their website to complain, they replied that they use ""a mix of functional descriptions and specific ingredients on...labels"", to ""allow us to refine formulas without the expense of having to reprint labels with each refinement"". And just try to uncover from their website, what the actual ingredients are. I am admittedly not a computer genius (read brain fog), but it took an unreasonable amount of digging to uncover the ingredient list.The point of my review here for Dishmate Liquid is, after I found it to be so body friendly that I could have prolonged contact without sensitivity symptoms, I decided to try it as a body wash (my skin was irritable no matter what I used to wash it). It was great! I no longer felt ""bad"" after taking a shower. It was only a matter of time before I tried it as a shampoo and, surprise, it doesn't hurt your eyes (as gentle as a baby shampoo), and my hair is beautiful!I no longer buy any soaps, body washes or shampoo. I add a few drops of essential oil to diluted Ultra Dishmate as a hand and body wash. I have recommended (and gifted) this liquid to anyone I know with allergy, chemical sensitivity, or skin problems.The best part of this is, since I have minimized contact with major sources of irritation, the entire chemical sensitivity problem has become much less prominent in my life. This Dishmate Liquid has actually improved my life! Try this. It may be a change for you too!",household supplies

"While these crayons do break (if, for example, your toddler leaves them on the floor and you or your husband steps on them, they are likely to break) it would take a lot of concentrated effort to break them while drawing. They are very durable.We also like that:-Apparently they do not taste as good as Crayola crayons. My dedicated wax-eater took one bite and has not aimed them at her mouth since.-They do not have wrappers so your toddler does not need you to repeatedly ""open it"".-They come in a fairly durable, handy plastic case.-They are triangular an thus, do not roll (under the couch, for example).Cons:-I have a hard time seeing how I could efficiently sharpen these. Advice in the comments section (besides using one of my dear kitchen knives) is welcome...My daughter has used the Crayola jumbo-sized crayons and while those are not bad, these are definitely superior. In my opinion, they are worth the price.Edited 24 January 2011:I will also add that now, two years later, we bought the new Crayola triangle crayons since these were getting a little worn down. One month after the Christmas Crayola fiasco, we have two of the triangular Crayola crayons, and we still have all of the original Melissa and Doug ones (and the box). The Crayolas broke one after another and the (new) baby got irritated by the paper. I have nothing against Crayola, and we have a lot of their other products.

"Recently I received a beautiful male Betta in a round fish bowl as a housewarming gift. ""Puffin"" was inactive, just floated around, and appeared bored. It seemed cruel to keep him in such a small home, so a few days later I researched and then bought this great multi-view hexagon fish tank, a live bamboo plant with lots of leaves, a pretty rainbow rock, and some artificial plants of varying heights and styles. Also added a Marineland Stealth 25 watt (up to 8 gallons) heater to keep the water at the perfectly-set temperature, and a Marineland timer to schedule the on/off lighting times of the underhood light. Within minutes of being placed in this fish tank, Puffin ""came alive"" and was energetically swimming around and exploring his new home. And, as another reviewer noted about her fish, my Betta gets his exercise by swimming against the filter's water flow and letting it push him backwards...just like a little kid riding the waves on a boogy board! He really enjoys it! I love the tank's hexagon shape because it provides easy viewing from any angle in the room. Relaxing on the couch with only the light from the fish tank illuminating the room, and listening to the whisper-soft sound of the water is soooo soothing! My friends and family love it, too! Would highly recommend this fish tank to anyone with a Betta or with 3-5 small fish.",fish aquatic pets
"I guess, for this kind of products, it is reasonable to expect not too much accuracy. Cause if you think about the type of measurement this device uses, you will notice that variations in your body within the day will make this thing fluctuate, though I don't know, by how much.I bought this just to have an easy to use reference device. The results, well, if I take a few readings, I can guess, what is the most accurate this device reads (within 1% of its own accuracy). However, still, what I get is 6-7% lower than what another supposedly more accurate device gives. But, on the basis, they use similar electric-current based measurements (this from the hands, the other from the shoulder). And, knowing my body, I expect something in between.In short, if you are a person trying to lose fat, and your goal is to reduce your body fat percentage by around 5 or more percent, this may do its job well. At least, that is the main reason I bought this device. I cannot expect it to be accurate for a 1% change, but for 5% or so, it should show me acceptable results.After reading some negative reviews here, I would at least suggest you to give the device a chance before making the final decision on it. I will take various readings within the day using this one, and the other more accurate one, to see its actual performance, so that I can make the necessary adjustments myself to the results that the device gives me. I may update with the results I get from that one, if I have the chance later on.",medical supplies equipment

"I work for an industrial electronics repair company and my 8 year old has visited me at work many times. He is fascinated by the types of equipment that we have at our facility for repair and has asked me tons of questions to which I don't have the answers (I am not a technician). I ordered this set for him as a Christmas gift since I knew it was something that would interest him, but it was not something that he had asked for. After the dust settled under the tree, imagine my surprise when it was the first gift he opened to play with. He very quickly built the ""flying saucer"" and the ""space war"" models. The instructions are fantastic- in color and easy to follow with explanations for each model. And the number of models and variations that can be built with this set will keep him busy for quite some time. He hasn't even had it a week and has played with it 4 or 5 times already. I am also impressed with the quality of this set. The parts seem to be durable and should stand up to the demands of a very curious 8 year old.As for the educational/learning value of this set, I can honestly say that he has truly learned something from playing with it and I think he is very proud of what he has learned. Today he went with me to my office and he started up a conversation with one of the technicians (who was in the process of repairing a large circuit board) about circuit boards, resistors, jumper cords - all items at the technician's station, that he had just learned about with this set. Fantastic!!",learning education

"I have owned this filter for a couple years now and it works brilliantly, it always quickly gets the water crystal clear after I have muddied up the water from cleaning the aquarium, it is very easy to use and clean except for the biological media bouncing all over the place like bacteria infused Kix cereal and the priming feature is brilliant. Also this thing is in the open in my bedroom and I can't hear a thing as long as I put a pad under it so it doesn't vibrate against floor. The only complaint I have is the water pressure dropping over the years. When I first bought it, the ecco 2234 would put so much pressure into the tank it turned it into a river with the current, the fish used to go swim in the current like salmon. Unfortunately no amount of cleaning and scrubbing and replacing filters gets the pressure and water circulation back to what it was when I first bought it. I had purchased this for a tank that is half the size the filter is rated for so the filter does absolutely fine even with the weak pressure. I would recommend this filter, however make sure you buy one that is rated for a much larger tank.",fish aquatic pets

"These refill tubes are for theJakks Creepy Crawlers Bugmaker. The machine itself comes with 3 or 4 initial goop tubes, but if you're anything like my son, you'll blow through those tubes fast and will soon be ready for more goop!The plastic creations are NOT edible....just rubbery fun.When heated, the goop does emit a plasticy odor that was mildly unpleasant, but not unbearable. the smell dissipates quickly. Also, we did spill some of the liquid goop on a shirt and it washed out with no stains or visible mess.There are a couple of different manufacturers that make goop. I have found that the goop made by ToyMax cooks a little faster than the goop made by Mattel - but the differences are minimal and the products are mostly interchangeable.Refill packs do vary in colors, so don't go by the picture posted on the product page. The refill set we ordered came with teal, yellow and brown. I found that my son doesn't care at all which colors he gets, he loves them all. But if you are looking for specific colors, you will probably have to skip buying online and pick these up in person. I have seen them in most large toy stores, and even in some of the larger department stores.I also recommend the glow in the dark goop:Creepy Crawlers GLOW IN THE DARK Official Plasti Goop Compound Refill 3 Pack Assorted Colors.You can also find additional plate molds online. Here is one:Additional Creepy Crawlers Mold Pack- we started with bugs but have found additional plate molds for monsters, flowers, disney characters, star wars, etc. Check out MJ Thompson's Creepy Crawler website (I found it through google) for more inforamtion than you'd ever care to know about all things creepy crawler related!",arts crafts

It's so easy to collapse and open. I particularly liked that fact that it is 17"" wide rather than the standard 19"". My mother is very thin so this was fine. I just thought it's hard enough to get through doorways as it is, the narrower (if the person can fit in it) the better. DO take that into consideration! The only other transporter that is lighter than this one is made from Medline, called the featherlite transporter (or something like that) at under 15lbs...but it is 19"" wide. This wheelchair is 19 lbs and it still felt really light to me. I'm only 5'3"" tall, and I had no trouble pushing my mom around.I bought this chair along with a cushion. DO get a cushion because transporter chairs don't have much support for the tushie. The other thing to be aware of are the foot rest. They do flop around once you fold up the chair. I recommend getting a small zippered nylon tote bag that is small enough to hold the foot rest and store in the back chair's pocket when not in use. The foot rests are very easy to remove. But they can fall out when not in use. So get a small carrying bag for them.The nylon fabric is sturdy and well-made.

If you write something on them small and then shrink them it is like micro printing a special message. When they shrink they get a little thicker and hard so they ring a little when they hit stuff. These make great cell phone charms. Use good markers to color them before shrinking. You can color both sides but it is difficult to match sides. It is cool when they shrink because it starts out so uneven like crinkled paper and in about fifteen seconds after it starts it evens out just right.

I have also had good experiences with other Whisper filters I've owned in the past. I have not been putting up with it for about 1.5-2 months. I loath this filther. First, the suctions cups don't stay on so the filter continuously falls into the tank. There should also be at least 4 suction cups. Having 2 placed in the center of the filter means it rocks back and forth and is not secure. Second, the bracket you can use in place of the top suction cup doesn't fit on the lip of my tank.

This coating is quite sweet and melts in the heat.I would not reccomend particular Nature Valley line for outdoor activities in the warmer months, but would not hesistate to for the winter months.It is also a great treat to get kids off candy bars and into healthier granola bars as the sweet coating is quite peanuty and sweet enough. The bar itself does contain crisped rice that their original crunchy line does not, but it is still a vast improvement healthwise over other more common snack bars available.",breakfast foods

"I was looking for a replacement for Odwalla Chocolate Chip Peanut bars and tried these. I'd go back to the Odwalla Bars in a flash which have whole peanuts and whole choc chips.

"I agree that this filter system is a quality product. This was my first aquarium filter system and I did my homework to make sure I bought a problem free and effective system for my new red-earred slider and fish friends. I live in Hawaii close to sea-level, so my 100 gal Rubbermaid stock tank is my outside aquarium on blocks under a tree. It's necessary to follow all directions. One of the most important is to keep the filter at the correct level below the water level. I have my tank on 3 rows of cement blocks and still had to dig a hole where my XP3 sits inside a 10 gal bucket. I went overboard with too many fish, but the filter still had no problem keeping all critters healthy and the turtle spends most of his time chasing his girlfiend red koi and basking on an island made out of PVC and coated chicken wire. I only have to change the mechanical filters monthly, and only the micro (white) filters cannot be reused. To keep algae down I added a UV filter. I find that the nitro-zorb, bio-zorb, and phos-zorb packets that Rena makes keep the water very clean. 16 months now and my XP3 is still quiet and efficient. I liked it so much I bought a spare. I see that the price is going up, so, since these turtles live over 40 years, maybe I should get yet another while I still have a job!",fish aquatic pets

"Twelve years ago, I bought one of these to replace another brand. The previous pump had not lasted long in a pond environment, and this model was recommended to me because of its efficiency and quality.The water in my pond was not always the cleanest and sometimes the pump had to tolerate the extra stress from a filter that was clogged with algae. After 12 years of fairly constant use, 24 hours a day, I needed to replace it.I am now on my second one, which I expect to last a long time. The build seems slightly improved, and the power cord is now more robust. The box came with a number of accessories that were not included in the past. That makes it more convenient to hook it up under a variety of conditions.If this pump can withstand being fully submersed in a murky pond for over a decade, it's enough to satisfy me.

"We bought this yesterday at Petco. Our betta, Diego, was dead by morning.We thought the tank was great until we put Diego in it. As soon as we turned on the air pump, it looked like he was struggling. We turned it off. We thought maybe he was just stressed (he lived a bowl for four months) so we decided to turn the air pump back on a short time later so he could become accustomed to it. After a couple of hours, he had planted himself on the bottom of the tank. This is normal betta behavior so I thought he had gotten used to his new surroundings. A couple of hours after that, he floating at the top. We turned off the air pump and went in to retrieve the carcass but he swam away from the net. Our little guy held on for a little while. He died in the night.Though this tank is very nice looking, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SUPPLIED AIR PUMP FOR BETTAS. The current is too strong. Bettas come from Southeast Asia, specifically, river drainage basins of in Thailand and Cambodia. In their natural habitat, the water is very near stagnant.

There is enough contrast of colors and living things in this, that putting it together was quite smooth. There are certainly some challenging areas, like the greenery, but once he put the tiger together, and I worked on the pink hibiscus, it went beautifully. It took us about 2 weeks, we both work.

Pros:I left for the entire summer for my job and haven't been home to feed the fish although a friend is changing the water that is by no means a daily thing. I didnt even bother using the batteries it came with as I never trust the batteries I get with items as they are often dead or near dead. Just put a new set of batteries in and your ready to go. The programming is easy and required little to no work. The instructions help but if you've ever programmed a digital watch its about the same level of complexity. I highly recommend this item. Pellets/small flakes are the way to go and a mix could work as well.Cons:Mount is not very good but easily modified to fit and aquarium. It is easily reversible as well.,fish aquatic pets
We bought these last year and my kids (5 and 1 1/2) absolutely love them! Not only is it fun to draw with them but it is really fun to get out some water and paint over whatever you drew.

"I've done some research and I think this is a very good product for overprotective parents like myself who want to make sure that their children get perfect nourishment even after being weaned or reaching age one. The drawback is that the formula tastes like pond scum. I really nearly vomited when I drank it, but my daughter didn't seem to mind it. I'm sure the DHA is what gives it the fishy taste. If the idea of it disgusts you, don't buy this product and instead feed your child flax meal and wild salmon (or similar DHA foods) if they're ready. That's what we ended up doing. Feeding our daughter whole milk after age one was a lot easier than mixing the formula and was a whole lot more practical.",baby food

But, while it is a *little* messy, it's not nearly as bad as I was expecting. The food coloring does make it MORE messy - so if you're nervous, start with one of the recipes that doesn't need coloring (or just skip that ingredient! At least for the first batch) She and a friend did this (with my help) and had a blast. They were so proud of their creations and even had fun trying to invent their own names for their gum. The flavor of the gum goes pretty quickly when you're chewing it (and the jury is still out on how well it ""keeps"") but I think all that is secondary to the actual fun in CREATING your own gum.

"I don't specifically disagree with the first reviewer -- but he makes some claims that I, personally, cannot find information on the box to support. Yes, they group the ""whole grains and seeds"" as first ingredient (actually, the first set of ingredients). Within this ""ingredient"", they include whole wheat flour, black and white sesame seeds, millet, mustard seeds, poppy seeds, triticale meal, rye meal, malted wheat flakes, oats, brown rice meal, and barley flakes). Then the next ""ingredient"" is enriched flour.The problem is that there is no way to determine whether the first ""ingredient"" is 80% of the total recipe or 40% -- and no way of knowing, within that amount, how much is in each sub-ingredient. I suspect that they did this unusual grouping of ingredients to hide their recipe -- but, as noted by the other reviewer's reaction, it may very well be counter-productive. If they had split out the set of ingredients into their separate parts, one would have a much better idea as to how it is made.I have been counseled that I am pre-diabetic. For me, therefore, it is very important to keep up the dietary fiber in the carbohydrates that I eat (slows digestion, keeps insulin levels steadier). Looking through my local supermarket, the GrainsFirst crackers was the only cracker & cheese type of cracker that met the criteria of 2g dietary fiber or more per serving (they actually list exactly 2g). It's tasty and it fits my dietary needs (sure, I'd rather have 3 or 4g -- work with what one can get).There are other crackers that meet the dietary criteria -- like Triscuits and a few others -- but they aren't really the same category of cracker in my opinion.Worth some extra money -- but you may be able to beat the price from Amazon if you can find them locally.",snack food
"My sons often raid my cabinets for my sushi nori. (Nori is the Japanese name for this product, called ""Kim"" in Korean) They just eat sheets of it, not even bothering to toast it sometimes. This is the kind of seaweed that they wrap sushi in. I usually hide my packages of Nori sheets, so that I have enough to use when I want to make my vegetable sushi rolls with brown rice.When I saw this product, I decided to give it a try, and I must agree--it is DELICIOUS! You get 24 little packs of tiny nori (kim) sheets, roasted in sesame oil and lightly salted. There's hardly any calories in this--25 per pack--but the main nutritional value is vitamin A (39%) and vitamin C (20%). I think that the flavor is wonderful, but it may be strange if you aren't used to seaweed or sushi. In that case I suggest that you just buy a small package of it somewhere first, and see how you like it. Anyway, the little packs are attractive, and handy to grab for snacking. As other reviewers have pointed out there is a lot of packaging involved in order to protect the fragile tiny sheets, but probably no worse than packs of cookies or chips, I think.I like this stuff, and I'm going to gift most of it to my now grown sons, because I know they'll love it. I haven't tried any other snack packs of nori (KIM), so I can't compare. But I can suggest, that if you like to eat this stuff, but don't want all the packaging, you can buy nori sheets by the bulk pack. We like to toast them lightly over an open flame, which is kind of fun, but don't let your little kids do this alone! The flavor is good, though drier and less salty than the ""Sea Gift"" snacks. Either way, Nori/Kim is a terrific seaweed!",snack food

My daughter on the other hand hasn't taken to it. All children are not created equally and each has their likes and dislikes. I'm still hopeful that she'll take to this, but for now it's a no go.

"The Ravensburger Stow and Go Puzzle Accessories does do exactly what it says on the box - it just doesn't do it well.The mat is folded inside the box, so when you receive it, it's bumpy and raised. We read the instructions and used it as directed, but it was so uneven it was frustrating to use. In hindsight it would have been a good idea to iron it, but there are no directions in doing so and I was concerned I would burn it based on the type of material it is made from.There are a few strips of sticky substance on the back covered by a plastic film, and absolutely no related instructions or directions about what it is supposed to be for or how it is used. Now we have not used a puzzle mat before so we are ignorant in this aspect, but isn't that what the instructions are supposed to be for? We assumed it was to hold the puzzle pieces in place, but I was concerned that if we removed the plastic film, and did not complete the part of the puzzle that would sit on top of the sticky strips before we rolled it up, then surely the lint from the mat rolling onto itself would get all over the sticky strips and render them useless anyway?Sure enough, when we rolled up the puzzle put it away, the puzzle broke inside the mat. When we unrolled it to work on the puzzle further, we had to spend a large amount of time fixing the puzzle and putting pieces back together.Not what I expected, and probably not worth using next time.",puzzles
"The SEA GIFT KOREAN ROASTED & SEA SALTED SEAWEED SNACKS are a wonderful treat if you like snacks with good flavor.I like well-seasoned foods and even though these have a nice salted flavor, I would have preferred a saltier taste. But these seaweed sheets have just the right amount of flavor for most people.If you don't know what seaweed snacks are they are sheets of dehydrated seaweed that's been roasted and seasoned with salt or soy sauce, and can be eaten either with rice or alone. They're thin like paper and slightly different from the type of seaweed that's used for wrapping sushi, which is not seasoned.Each seaweed rectangular sheet measures about 3.25"" x 2.25"" and comes in 11 sheets per package. There are 24 packs in each order so that's plenty for making rice balls or adding to other dishes or just eating alone.I agree with another reviewer who stated that there was a lot of packaging for such a small amount in each pack, but I've tried other dried ""nori"" seaweed snacks and once you open the container, you have a set amount of time to eat all the seaweed or it will get hard and stick together. Perhaps that's why these are packaged individually in sheets of 11.Anyway, I really like these seaweed snacks and will be ordering more!",snack food

"I had high hopes for these. I mean, crunchy cheese, what's not to love? But they have more of a ""processed"" taste than I would have liked. I found myself having trouble finishing the tiny half ounce bag. I gave them a fair chance, kept an open mind, but after three bags I'm going to have to find someone to give the rest to. The flavor is definitely more salt than cheese. Perhaps the other flavors would be better but since it was a pure love of cheese that lead to the purchase, I'm really not interested in trying any of the other flavors. Oh well, it was worth a try.",snack food

"I received a Superplexus as a gift about 5 years ago, and I still have it today. It's constructed of a very hard, almost unbreakable plastic, but it is not resistant to scratches, as mine has a few from letting children play with it. As far as the actual game play goes, it is extremely fun, and challenging, without being overly frustrating. You could literally play for hours trying to guide that tiny metal ball through the expertly designed maze of obstacles. I like that you can start from the beginning of the maze, at point 1, or you can start at 2 other checkpoints along the maze instead, at points 26 and 59, for those that have already mastered the first 25 checkpoints and want to practice from 26 on. As far as the electronics to the game go, I don't really use them, as I find them annoying, but it does make noises and keeps track of times through the maze and such. Overall, a really well built, fun, and challenging toy. Highly recommended.",puzzles

"Our 20 gallon salt tank is my first attempt with a salt water aquarium. I've done a lot of research reading reef forums and articles, trying to understand the way different types of protein skimmers work. For our size tank, and with the help of other reviews, I decided that less expensive was the better way to go for now. This skimmer seems fairly easy to set up and adjust, but it takes a little while to generate enough foam to collect in the cup. Ours is also a new tank, so there may not be as much to skim off. The bubbles produced by the limewood are very small and profuse, and fill the reactor chamber. We set ours up tonight at about 5 p.m. and it's now 9 p.m. It has built up about an inch of foam head and climbing, so I expect there will be skimmate in the collection cup by morning.Overall, the construction of the skimmer is acrylic about 1/16th inch thick, slip fit together. The slip fit part is a little annoying when trying to get the skimmer positioned in the tank (this could be a coordination issue on my part). However, once installed and running, the only part that will need to be moved is the collection cup, which requires no force to remove so it won't dislodge the rest of the skimmer. I'm very happy with it in general, works good, last s long time (probably), cheap price.",fish aquatic pets

"Unsalted organic corn chips are the absolute best choice when entertaining. Tortilla chips almost always accompany salsa or nacho cheese sauce and additional salt found with other chips can become overwhelming. The sweet corn goodness is great while eating these alone and not necessarily requiring a complimenting side-kick. You cannot go wrong by having an available supply in your pantry to serve whenever guests crave a snack or as a personal snack or meal ingredient. I also purchased a case of the elRio brand (my choice was mild) nacho cheese sauce from Amazon and it was a perfect match to these chips.

She only knows a few of the letters by their actual names, but when she picks up almost every letter here she can state the picture associated with it. So, 'I' isn't 'I,' but ""ice cubes,"" and W is 'watch,' etc. She's never even seen a jellybean, but she screams ""jellybean!"" when she grabs the J. Awesome. It's a great challenge for her little fingers too - her dexterity has improved from initially just slapping the letters down in the approximate region of where they belonged, to lots of twisting and turning to slot each one and now, finally, she can place them correctly about half the time. I love that the letters that could be symmetric, like the Z, aren't, and that the u and n are the same color - it's more interesting this way! Yes, the pictures underneath the letters are unusual... and I'd much rather use this opportunity to teach her what a quail is than have her know only the ubiquitous 'Queen' as her Q-word. I only gave three stars for durability because the letters are not appropriate for chewing upon. They're quite substantial dry, but need to be kept out of little mouths. Just another reason to play with this one together at first.Update. A few years later, we love it as much as before.

My 4 year old was given this as a birthday gift and she loves all things messy and paint related. My first thought after opening the package was that the stiff card stock that it comes with would not be much more than an hours worth of supplies and the paint bottles while fitting nicely into the holders are pretty small. My second concern was that the paper seemed not to fit!! I pulled the box out of the trash and realized the paper slips in with the corners not the sides! That would explain some of the other reviewers complaints - problem solved. We also had problems with it slowing down after a while. This was a direct result of letting the paint build up at the bottom of the tray. My daughter is very heavy handed with the paint and there seems to be no problem with spin if there is no bottom build up. As for the splatter... if the shield is not on in the proper spot it will spray out. It is not difficult to put in properly and has not been an issue. All in all we love this activity. The machine is light weight and noiseless making it easy to get out and have fun. We have yet to try different kinds of paint and there seems to be no refill information.

If you love chocolate and coconut, especially together, in one chewy concoction, you would find these cookies addictive. And they are vegan too.",snack food

"Contrary to popular belief, Wild bettas live in vast rice paddies for most of the year, and are trapped in small puddles for only a few months out of the year. It's not that they prefer small bodies of water, but that they can survive in them for a few months. Otherwise they live in vast amounts of water.Additionally, while wild bettas may be able to survive in small puddles for a small time, fancy bettas are not similar to wild bettas in this aspect; they need stimulation (like plants and hiding areas) and prefer larger aquariums (personal experience as well as research).I understand the appeal of this aquarium, but I'd only keep a plant in here. Otherwise, I don't consider this a suitable living space for a Betta. It's affordable, so if you need a temporary aquarium while setting up a real aquarium (waiting for the good bacteria to set up and all of that), this is fine.",fish aquatic pets

They all taste like cardboard compared to breastmilk."" and then she recommended Good Start.I had never heard of it before but based on her recommendation, I tried it. Maybe my baby just gave up at that point, but for whatever reason, he started drinking it from the first try.The only downside is that it is more difficult to find in stores compared to Enfamil or Similac.

"I'm very picky about clean water, so I choose a canister filter for my 29 gallon aquarium. The Eheim 2213 is excessive for my aquarium size, but my next purchase will be a 50 gallon tank.I choose a canister filter because they are constructed like a filter in a water treatment plant. The multi-stage filtration system produces crystal clean water. This filter is almost silent when primed - the first week I checked to see if it was running several times. I have the filter sitting below the aquarium on the back of the stand and have never had a water leak. If assembled correctly, this should never be a problem. Using Vasoline when connecting the hoses eases installation considerably.The direction were difficult to follow, but I entered `Eheim 2213' into (utube) and was able to quickly assemble the filter and tubing by following one of the video links. Once you understand how the filter should be assembled, within 20 minutes you should have the filter running in the aquarium.If properly primed, the filter will work almost silently. Any noises from the filter should indicate a priming failure and should be corrected immediately. A pump not properly primed will burn will burn out in short order.After three months with normal water changes, the water is still crystal clear. From now on, I will only purchase Eheim filters for my aquariums. It's money well spent in my opinion.",fish aquatic pets

Also, the small blocks made it so I ate something small every 20 minutes instead of a gel every 50 minutes.

"I received this as part of the Amazon Vine and only got one bar to try. So I cannot say if the flavor is consistent between bars and I cannot judge if all are supposed to taste like this.As advertised, this is an Organic & Raw product. So if you have never had raw cashews, cherries or dates, you may not get the flavor you expect, especially with the cashews. Most people are used to them salted and roasted. In this bar, the dates and walnuts were the dominate flavor, not the cherries or the cashews. It tasted more like a raisin walnut bar, than a cherry cashew bar.The bar is a little small compared to most snack bars, about an inch and a half by three inches and the package is a little deceptive in that is larger than the bar by over an inch.Overall, I can't give it a high rating since the Cherry and Cashew flavor is dominated by the Date and Walnut. And as I said, I only have one bar to try, so I don't know if others are better, but for the price I would expect the flavor listed to be correct and the bars to be a bit bigger.",breakfast foods
"Each bar is quite heavy and dense, packed with what tastes like a pure mix of dates and nuts interspersed therein. There is a very slight cherry flavor that primarily manifests itself as a sour after-taste. The bar has absolutely NO ""refined sugars, gluten, dairy or soy, cholesterol, transfats, preservatives, GMOs, or artificial anything elses"". Appearance wise, it looks like a 1 cm thick brownie with a sprinkling of nuts. It has a higher calorie and fat count than I was expecting for an organic snack bar.Here are the primary nutrition facts for one bar (other quantities of constituents are negligible);Calories",breakfast foods
"The Pure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar is a tasty snack that much healthier for you than a vending machine candy bar. Just keep in mind that this is organic, but *not* a diet food.The first ingredient is dates, and in fact the overall flavor is that of dates, with a subtle hint of cherries, and nuts. There is also a bit of ""sawdust"" consistency to the bar, not sure if this is from the ground nuts or the organic rice protein. I enjoyed the flavor of this bar; the dates and cherries make a fine combination.It's not sweet compared to a candy bar, but there is enough natural sugar in it from the dates, cherries, and agave nectar to total 17 grams of sugar in a bar. There is also 8 grams of fat from the ground cashews, walnuts, and almonds. Though certainly healthier than standard candy bars, these still have to be considered a fairly high calorie ""treat"" and not a diet food.In all, I really did like the Pure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar; I received a free sample for the purposes of this review, but would happily buy a box of these in the future.",breakfast foods
"I'll admit I'm not generally a healthy eater and don't have too many organic fruit bars, so I'm not sure what to compare this with. However, I thought it was pretty good. It's a bit like a soft granola bar - you can taste the grains, without the crunch. However, for me at least, the cherry flavor wasn't very strong. I love anything cherry (I drink cherry-flavored seltzer regularly), and thought this bar had more of a strawberry-cashew flavor. Still tasty nonetheless.",breakfast foods
"This was a pretty good mid-afternoon snack! Cherry flavor can be intense, but here it was well-balanced with the cashews and rice protein blend. I gobbled this down without looking at the ingredients, and it didn't stand out as being obviously organic in any way. Then I looked at the wrapping and saw that it's gluten-free, refined sugar-free, and preservative-free. So if you like granola bars but want something that's natural, this would fit the bill nicely.",breakfast foods
"I love nuts, and having lots of them jammed into a snack bar is a nice thing. This item is exactly that.Since it's a mix, do not expect to taste each nut separately, but it tastes well. My only complaint is that the dates (as in fruit) in it are a little bit dominant in the taste, making it slightly more sweet than I expected. Yet this is natural sugar, and can be balanced easily with a cup of water.",breakfast foods
"I've had a variety of fruit bars over the years and this is definitely one of the worst. It doesn't have a great deal in the way of good flavor and it's over burdened with cashews and walnuts (neither of which I like). The labeling makes great hey out of the fact that it's not got gluten, doesn't use GMO's, has no cholesterol, no trans-fats, and that the blueberries used therein are raw. Because, you know, mankind was doing fine before we actually started cooking our foods.Beyond the hype of the product, there's not really anything worthwhile here, and lord help you if you have a nut allergy. This thing just didn't taste good and I can't say as though I have any interest in ever eating any more. Put it this way",breakfast foods
"I'm always looking for tasty, easy-to-eat snacks like granola bars and the like. Something you can hold in one hand and consume in a few bites so you can resume your normal activities recharged and ready.This Pure Blueberry Fruit and Nut Bar boasts some significant virtues in terms of its natural and organic content, but I think its price and flavor will deter me from switching from the Nature Valley Sweet and Salty Peanut Granola Bars I rely on now.Yes, those Nature Valley Bars are chock full of corn syrup, but they taste great, they're very filling -- and with the Amazon Subscribe and Save program, I can get them delivered to my door for about fifty cents a bar.In comparison, these Pure Bars are running around $2 apiece -- that's quite a cost difference.As to their flavor, I would grade them a C+ or B-. Not bad... no unfortunate after-taste... but nothing that will get your mouth watering either.Still, if you're someone who eats nothing but organic food -- and you can afford the privilege -- by all means try these. If you like whole grain bars, you may like the taste more than I did.",breakfast foods
"This bar is obviously marketed and created for those looking for a ""pure"" bar with nothing extra added. While the concept is there, the lack of a good taste certainly isn't. It isn't horrendous by any means, but certainly isn't the best tasting bar I've ever eaten. That being said, it is healthy, and is nice to be able to have an alternative like this finally come to market. I think the majority of the major food businesses (i.e. Kelloggs, General Meals) aren't going to the level this product does. If you're the type of person looking for something healthy, but doesn't take the best, then this is perfect for you. For those out there, like me, that care more about the taste, you're probably better off looking elsewhere.",breakfast foods
"When I opened the package I was a bit skeptical. The bar is rather small looking, and frankly not too visually appealing. The flavor however, is absolutely outstanding. The bar is dense and flavorful, packed with all kinds of nuts and fruits with the dominant flavors being cashews and tart cherries. I was pleased that the bar is not overly sweet, rather focusing on the nuts and the natural sugars from the fruit. The bar is actually quite filling too, and can easily act as a healthy snack that could replace a light lunch or breakfast. I will definitely be ordering more and trying the other flavors. It's like a bag of trail mix packed into a snack bar. Highly recommended!",breakfast foods
"I tried both the blueberry and the cherry versions. Although I really like Blueberry and the health benefits of the blueberry are unsurpassed, I have to say I liked the cherry cashew bar better.This is an extremely nice and convenient little bar. The taste of the cherry is wonderfully good-reminiscent of the intensely flavorful Montmorency Cherries with a superior texture and quality.The cashew of the bar adds a nice balance to the cherry. The nuttiness lends a nice chewiness to the bar, keeping it from an overly soggy texture.These bars are a very enjoyable treat. It's nice to have something like this at your desk-keep your hands clean, while keeping those hunger pangs away!The ingredients list is also very good. The emphasis on organic ingredients insure that this food is chemical and pesticide -free.",breakfast foods
"When I look at the bar it seems normal sized, but when I open it and see how large it really is, it seems slightly smaller than other bars. I take a bite and the first thing I notice is the nutty flavor, with a hint of blueberry aftertaste. The bar itself is soft and ever so slightly sticky, but not sticky enough to be messy. This bar is very densely packed material. Not crumbly or flakey.I appreciate the fact that this is all organic and very healthy and that nothing is cooked and processed. But I wonder how they deal with e-coli and the like. E-Coli is found on plants and in animals. The bar clearly states that it isn't processed or cooked. I know there have been E-Coli scares with raw juices and spinach and other produce so I do wonder how they try and prevent it in their product.The flavor has a weird sweetness to it. Maybe that is the nature of unprocessed food! I don't eat a lot of organic food and the only raw food I eat is plain fruits and veggies. When I bake I tend to pile on the sugar or honey in some cases for sweetness, so that is the flavor I am accustomed to.So for me this bar is not a good match, if I were to buy a fruit bar (which I don't do often) I'd probably stick to good ol' Nutragrain which has a flavor somehow more familiar. But I think for someone is are ultra careful about what they ingest or for someone who only eats raw food this would be an ideal choice. Actually, if I were part of the raw food movement, I'd tout this bar as a fast convenient snack.",breakfast foods

Would reccomend this for any fresh/salt aquarium that has surface film build up.",fish aquatic pets
"My favorite dried fruits are dried cherries. So I was really kidding myself when I broke off a small piece of this bar just to taste it...thinking I'd finish it later. NOT. In addition to tasting great, nothing in this bar has been cooked, and all ingredients are organic. It's also gluten free and preservative free.I had planned to eat this bar with a cup of tea for lunch or a snack, but it ended up being dessert. It's nice to have something taste this good without having to feel guilty about eating it.",breakfast foods
"I know it's probably my fault for focusing on the ""blueberry"" vs. the ""nut"" on the label of the Pure Organic Wild Blueberry Fruit & Nut bar, but it definitely didn't meet my expectations. The dominant flavor of this bar is of walnuts. They're the third ingredient on the label after dates and cashews, but tastewise they take over. I only get the slightest taste of blueberry so I am quite disappointed. At 190 calories for the bar, they are about average for similar snacks and the ingredients list is all organic and raw. I wish I liked the flavor better.",breakfast foods
"My experiences with health and energy bars have been mixed. Most of the ones I've tried are pricey, taste terrible, and make me feel like I've swallowed powdered cement. So, I was cautious about Pure Bar. My general view, based on experience, is that the healthier and more ""organic"" it is, the worse it's going to be and this one is jam-packed with things like organic dates, organic cashews, organic rice protein concentrate, and other organic healthy stuff--so it couldn't possibly be delicious, right? Wrong. I was pleasantly surprised after the first bite hit my taste buds. These things are really good! Unlike most health bars I've tried, these are chewy and moist--not hard and dry. I don't have to wash this down with a drink in order to get it from my throat to my stomach, and there's no nasty aftertaste. And, the price is definitely reasonable!

My dad, who is 88 years old and loves everything (foodwise)thought it was ""super"", while my friend Keiko liked the way it tasted, but she didn't care for the way it smelled.

"The first and occasional taste of real blue berry made me keep trying another bite, but each time I did I became less satisfied with the bar. I was hoping that it would have been more like the KIND Fruit plus Nut Bar, which has a very satisfying taste and texture, but instead it was more like a chewy gooey unidentifiable powerbar with some nuts and fruit added. If you like the normal powerbar goo (which I do not), then this could be a good fit for you as the addition of the fruit and nuts could make it more interesting. It definitely felt like it would fill you up for the 190 calories, but I like to enjoy the food I it as well.",breakfast foods
"I had enjoyed the Cherry & Cashew bar by ""Pure"" so I thought that I'd give the Blueberry & Cashew bar a try. Some of the same descriptive information applies. The bar is firm & chewy, but not tough, and there are tiny pieces of cashew that give an occasional bit of crunchiness. The sugar content comes solely from the fruit itself. And fortunately, the bar isn't sticky to handle, which is a plus if you eat it on the go. As for the blueberry flavor, I'll say this. If you were to give me one of these bars to eat, and I had to guess what (if any) fruit flavor is in it, I'd be unable to guess. The Blueberry content is definitely there, and the bar tastes good. But I do prefer the cherry & cashew bar.",breakfast foods

I am a Nanny for several kids. The oldest two are 5 and 2.5 years old. I bought this for days where they couldn't play outside. It has come in handy. The larger foam beads are great for the 2.5 year old to handle. She doesn't even realize she is learning while she is having fun. It is great for gaining that hand-eye coordination. The only problem I have with he is that the holes are a little small which isn't a problem for the solid beads but when she comes across the beads where they have to feed it in several holes (like the letter O) she gets frustrated.

"I love to have meal bars in my purse because they are great when I don't have time to stop and eat a snack (and might otherwise reach for fast food). However, many of them have long ingredient lists or leave something to be desired in flavor. These Pure bars address this completely. Much like the Lara bars they have a short list of minimally processed ingredients. If you're tried of bars with lots of additives or ingredients you cannot pronounce you will likely find this refreshing. The taste is also pretty decent. Granted, it's all a matter of personal preferences, but I find these okay to eat. It's not something I would excitedly eat over dessert, but it's definitely palatable and does taste like cherry and cashew. I also tried the blueberry flavor and preferred that one (even though I am not generally a blueberry fan), but it was a matter of personal preference.If you've tried the Lara bars I would say the flavor and consistency are very similar. That said, they are definitely not as tasty or texturally appealing as the bars that have more ingredients (i.e. Odwalla or Luna). Of course, it's all about making tradeoffs so if a long ingredient list doesn't bother you, you may prefer the other two brands. However, if you're looking for somehting with a short ingredient list that is raw, vegan, gluten-free, or certified organic this is a good choice.The bottom line is this. I personally think it's hard to make a bar with only a few ingredients that are all natural that tastes as good as the more processed bars, but overall this one does a pretty good job.",breakfast foods

"I am a blueberry fan. I put them in lots of baked goods, eat them fresh every summer. So I was excited to try this bar in blueberry; I've been eating the PURE Cherry bars for some time now. I was surprised by the taste of these bars, neither pleasantly nor unpleasantly, just surprised. They were not very sweet - and the cherry bars are. So this was both good and bad. The cherry bars sometimes are too sweet and I feel like I've eaten candy afterward, whereas the blueberry bars have a subtle sweetness with a mellow flavor. The cashews dominate the taste in these. So, for every day fare, (especially for gluten free people) theses are much more grounding and more food-like than candy like. However, it's not necessarily a taste that I would crave every day. But that's me. They are definitely worth adding to your collection of bars - it's always nice to have variety. Enjoy!",breakfast foods

No cholesterol. Gluten-free. It's certified organic. It's a snack you can feel good about putting in your child's lunchbag.The blueberry bar had a good raw flavor - predominantly nuts (almonds, cashews and walnuts) - with the taste of wild blueberries. This healthy treat is one you don't have to feel guilty indulging in.",breakfast foods
"I was certainly glad to find that I had stuck my Pure Bar in my jacket pocket on a recent flight, when the only other offerings keeping me from starvation were airplane peanuts, so this review is definitely right-leaning in its bias. After not having had breakfast, this little bar of blueberryness made everything right with the world. It's certified vegan, Kosher, and organic (""no artificial nothin'""), no gluten, no trans fats, and it fills up the corners. Because of all its pluses, I would buy it again; on the side of fairness, however, it has the same amount of calories most bars of its type have, and while it is good, it doesn't knock itself out of the park. Shortly put, it's satisfying, and fills the needs of many who need to watch their intake of certain ingredients.",breakfast foods

I am always on the lookout for bars like this, especially given my attempt to lose weight this year.The Pure bar is a great filling snack. So many bars and snacks are lightweight and airy and don't satisfy. But the Cherry Pure bar really does fill you up and it tastes really good. The combination of the Cherry taste and the cashews and nuts is really a great taste.My only contention is that if you just want a light snack--this is not really it. Its pretty heavy. But if you're in the middle of the day or you want something quick for breakfast, I highly recommend it. Gives you energy and fills you up fast.",breakfast foods

In fact, we just reordered it in the larger 40oz bags (Bob's Red Mill Old Country Style Muesli, 40-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)) because the cost per ounce is a little less expensive.It can be a little boring to eat the same thing over and over again each morning so mix it up by having small Ziplock baggies of various raw nuts and dried fruit available to add as a topping. In our house, walnuts and extra raisins are a big hit though we also enjoy adding fresh fruit or a dollop of preserves from time to time.In the weeks that we have been eating this Muesli, both my husband and I have been amazed with how much more efficiently our bodies are digesting and eliminating waste. We not only feel better, but we are finding that we are looking better too.

"Not being a food chemist, I'm not sure what the deal is here with vegan and vegetarian ""meats."" I really like most veggie-based patties, ""chicken"" bits, and breakfast sausages. However, the various ""brats"" that I so desperately want to grill are, for the most part, terrible. And I don't just mean ""not meat-like."" I mean, they don't taste very good.The food chemists at the famous Monell Chemical Senses Center have, as I remember, ""hamburger in a vial."" That is, with your eyes closed, they can fool you into thinking there is a grilled hamburger in front of your face, when in reality it is a combination of chemicals they have isolated from this product.So how hard can it be to really simulate the flavor of bratwurst?In this case, it's jerky. It kinda looks okay (needs more imperfections... lumps and bumps), has somewhat the same consistency (you gotta pull hard or break off a piece), and, as far as the ""original hickory pepper"" flavor, you can tell it has pepper.But that first bite made me think of those veggie brats. Not a good association.I guess this just needs to be an acquired taste. I do appreciate the effort... the vegan product, the non-GMO soy, and the low-fat (in this case, 0 grams of fat) product.But can't those Monell scientists work up a vial of ""jerky taste and smell?""I'll be waiting.",snack food

Unfortunately, as several reviewers have stated, if you're not careful when using it, and a single grain of sand, for example, gets stuck between magnet and glass, you absolutely will scratch it.

Still, there's no question that it will scrape off whatever algae or other gunk or particles that has attached itself to the inside of your tank.

After I purchased these a couple of months ago, my husband declared that we weren't going to buy any other type of crayon ever again. They really are great! The case keeps them organized, and is handy to stick into a bag and carry in the car, a restaurant, or church. It stays closed (it can be a little difficult for children to open on their own) during travel and keeps them intact and ready to use.

It goes well with a variety of things including various cheeses and even tastes good with peanut butter. Moreover, it has practically no fat and lots of fiber. If you cannot eat wheat products or just want a good tasting alternative to crackers, this is a good choice at a very reasonable price. I do have one caution. This is not for folks who are gluten intolerant as rye flour does contain some gluten.",snack food

"Purchased this heater for a cichlid tank, set it up to keep the water temperature at about 79-80 degrees. Heater is very nice looking and the control knob seems to work well. The indicator light was a nice feature, flashing slow when the water temperature was very low, solid when heating and flashing fast if the water was too warm. Kept the temperature very stable for 3 weeks, at which time it became erratic, heating and then instantly flashing fast that the tank was too hot. Then it would shut off, flash that the tank was too cold, come back on, etc. This would all take place in a span of about 10 minutes. Obviously they have a problem with the thermostat as I have now read other sites with comments that are very similar. Warranty is a joke, as you have to ship it back at your expense along with $10 to cover their return shipping. I threw it out and replaced it with a Hydor in-line heater.

"This is delicious, classic Scottish-style porridge, but it took me a few tries to get it right. The microwave method simply doesn't work - you end up with a layer of hardened oats and exploding liquid on top. What is best to do is to use a pan. Boil the water as the package directs (though unless you want it salty, I'd use only a dash of salt as opposed to 1/2 tsp.). When you add the porridge, add it into the simmering water bit by bit, whisking throughly during and after. Then simmer as normal with the lid on. This method solved all my problems with the porridge. It made it fluffy, light and truly edible. No more scraping burnt porridge off the bottom of the pan or rushing to break up gluey lumps. Now, I make a batch of this and simply heat it up with a little milk and cinnamon every morning.",breakfast foods

If you have your water level right, you do not hear the waterfall effect that others have addressed.Also, I replaced the additional media in the filter with a better mesh to control phosphates and (hopefully) cut down on algae, and there was plenty of room for this material along with the bags and charcoal.I had looked at the more expensive cylinder filters but after assessing the cleaning problems, the leaking problems and the overall work involved, I chose to stick with the Whisper and spend my $$ on new fish and decorations!",fish aquatic pets

The first bag I opened were pretty good and I was feeling happy with my purchase. However, when I went to eat another bag I opened it and it had a very strong smell of rancid oil that dominated any salt and vinegar smell or flavor. I then opened 2 more bags and they had the exact same issue. Chips in these bags were essentially non-edible or at least not inanyway pleasant to eat. Rancid oil can't be a good thing to consume. Looking closely at the chips sent to me I saw they were manufactured in 2007 and have an expiration date of January 2011 - clearly they have already expired. This item is not returnable so I will be throwing all of the remaining bags of chips out. That means I will have spent almost $42 for one good 1-ounce bag of chips. So if you are thinking of buying such an item on amazon first inquire about how old the product is that will be shipped to you - I will definitely be doing that in the future.",snack food

"My daughter is on a shark frenzy. Everything has to be a shark. One item that I bought her for Christmas is this puzzle by Melissa and Doug of a majestic (but, for me, paralyzingly terrifying) shark surrounded by some little sea life in what looks like a reef, all held, presumably, in an aquarium. It contains 100 pieces, so the pieces are large enough for fine motor coordination of an older elementary aged child. It is sufficiently diverse figure - ground so that children can perceptually analyze and assemble a gestalt. Other than than the scary shark (sharks and snakes do it to me :( ) I believe that this image is very attractive. As an adult, I'm not THE best puzzle assembler, but, this one provides some challenge. I believe that this puzzle provides educational values - visual problem solving, fine motor coordination, viewing the small problem while also maintaining sight on the whole, how to attack a problem (corners, edges ...), and then, of course, all of the diversity of species, how they interact in nature, and how we set up tanks for the mutual benefit of the selection of species. There are so many avenues of discussion for parents and children that this alone can become a half-day's event. Now, I bring the internet with me everywhere, so I'm better prepared for those difficult questions. I believe that the puzzle pieces are clearly cut out and they fit snuggly together. It seems to be produced by quality craftsmanship using quality materials. I believe that it is quite durable, although a puzzle and an energetic little girl can lead to a lost piece, usually in the middle of the puzzle! I recommend this puzzle for curators of marine institutes, children's museums, science museums, aquariums, libraries - both public and school, as well as home enthusiasts. For folks intrigued and not frightened by sharks, this is an excellent purchase. I give everything a grade, and this puzzle I believe is overall worth an ""A-"".",puzzles

It is a soybean oil base so it's liquid.

He doesn't care if one side doesn't dry while he writes on the other; he actually flips back and forth with abandon. I cannot see this toy working for children older than 2, who are more aware of what the toy should provide. I am also bothered by all of the markings on the packaging about the toy being made in China, references to Hong Kong, etc. I do not need to be inundated with those things! No wonder it's such a crappy toy (from a knowing adult's perspective, anyway).",arts crafts

We aren't supposed to have more than 15 grams of sugar for a whole day, and this had 22 grams per cookie! Ugh! Pureed prune, evaporated cane juice, and more, made it very Unhealthy. Healthy would be stevia (which also lowers your blood pressure) and xylitol as they have a ""zero"" count for sugar but taste sweet.

"When they are pieces belonging to a Melissa and Doug Farm Sound Puzzle, that's when - and that's when the barnyard becomes confusing! The colorful nature of this puzzle, and the fact that each piece would cause the appropriate sound to be made were what attracted me to this puzzle for my grandson. At fourteen months-old, he is very interested in the sounds different things make; he loves to imitate different animals. This puzzle seemed the perfect Christmas gift.The puzzle base is made of wood, as are the individual pieces. Edges are smooth and there was no splintering which might injure a child. The animals were depicted realistically and the sounds were fairly representative of each animal.Unfortunately, we quickly discovered Melissa and Doug failed to work out the ""quirks"" of their sound puzzles prior to selling them. The actual sounds are either light activated or activated by a chip on each piece and in each cut-out, so covering a shape is what causes the animal to ""speak."" Our grandson quickly discovered that if he couldn't find the duck - his favorite animal at Christmas - he could cause the puzzle to quack using any of the other animals. All that was required was to bring another piece close enough to the duck-shaped cutout to activate the quack. Further, my daughter told me today that if pieces are missing and one turns off the lights in a room, there is a cacophony of sound.In my opinion, these are not an acceptable characteristics in an educational toy. While toddlers may find the noise and their ability to make a duck ""moo"" highly amusing, the supposed educational factor is missing. It would have been better if the different pieces had individualized activation chips or if the chip in each piece and matching cutout were located in different spots for each animal. The sensitivity would need to be such that pieces would have to be within a minimum distance - one in which a puzzle piece was actually being inserted in the cutout- to activate.I have rated this as only an average toy because of its deficiencies. That is a real shame as it could have been a five-star product if the items addressed above had not been present.",puzzles
"The cans are listed as 13 fluid ounces each, but I measured and each can was 12 ounces or less. Since you have to have equal parts water and formula, I had to carefully measure each can.

The already mixed formula is much cheaper per ounce than this or even the powder.",baby food
"The original construction of this puzzle included paint all around the puzzle piece. Now, it's just a cheap paper laminate on the top; the remainder of the puzzle piece is compressed cardboard. I called Melissa and Doug directly and asked whether they were still making the high quality version of the board, and she said they had discontinued it. They did offer to refund our money or send us an alternative toy, so that was nice. Ultimately, I kept the alphabet puzzle because it's one of the better ones out there. However, I hate how Melissa and Dough cut corners on the new version. Disappointing, and now the pieces are chipping/peeling on the top, which means it looks even worse.Recommendation",puzzles

"As far as keeping the pH in your aquarium at 7.0 this product works great if used according to the directions. It claims to remove chlorine, chloramine and ammonia with some kind of ""conditioning agents"" and this may very well be true but if you rely on chemical means to remove ammonia as opposed to doing water changes you are minimally asking for stressed fishes if not sick or dead eventually. In any case, the downfall to this product is that it is made up of phosphate salts, which as you add this product to your tank it causes the phosphates (PO4) to build in concentration. High levels of PO4 in your aquarium is not what you want because it can and will cause algae blooms beyond your control. Ideally, PO4 levels in your tank should be zero to very low levels that can't be detected with colorimetric test kits. If you have algae problems in your tank I highly recommend investing in a PO4 test kit. You must do a water change to get rid of phosphates, don't rely on any product to remove PO4 unless you have a reef tank (salt water) and need to remove low levels!As far as keeping your pH at neutral you would also make life much easier by investing in a pH pen (i.e. Waterproof pH Tester; ~$40-$100) and the calibration solutions for it. Use liquid pH down (API brand) and you can use store bought baking soda (Sodium Bicarbonate; NaHCO3; Arm and Hammer brand fine...cheap too!) to bring your pH up; however, you may still want some liquid pH up too. The NaHCO3 will increase your pH and carbonate hardness (Alkalinity) helping to stabilize your pH as the phosphate buffers do in Seachem's Neutral Regulator WITHOUT the PO4! Turn your pH pen on and take the pH of your tank while you add pH up or down until you increase or decrease the pH by no more than 0.2 pH units. In other words, if your pH is 6.4 and you want to be at 6.9 increase it from 6.4 to 6.6 the first day. Then the next day go from 6.6 to 6.8 etc. My experience is that in the above example you'll find that the pH of 6.6 you set the day before will drop by the following day so just work your way up incrementally. This is because the organisms in your aquarium utilize the carbonate. Also get yourself a hardness test kit too (API brand) that gives you general and carbonate hardness and follow directions for adjusting to levels suitable for your fishes. Incidentally, Drs. Axelrod's and Burgess's fresh and marine atlases, respectively, provide this information for numerous fishes. I know this sounds complicated but the reality is this is the proper way to maintain a fish tank. It's a hobby and should be fun to do! Dedicate some time to caring for the water quality and you'll have much healthier, vibrant and happy fishes!",fish aquatic pets

"The impeller is an acceptable replacement for the 150 Bio Wheel Power Filter, if you happen to need one.If you're buying this impeller, you must have worn out your old one and if you're like me you are buying it after only 1 month! Way too expensive to do on a long term basis, at that price it costs more than the entire new power filter after just 3 months. It was my bad though. I used very, very fine sand which got between the impeller shaft and housing and went about grinding between these until there were large grooves in the impeller shaft. This lends to a very noisy pump, so you have to replace. Plus, soon after the grooves begin to show and make noise, they deepen and eventually cause the impeller's blades to catch, pumping stops momentarily. its a noisy, inefficient operation. Unacceptable...so don't use fine sand in a power filter (or maybe just one marketed for only ~$25). You can do things to reduce the effect the suspended sand can have by reducing the amount of time you run the filter when sand is still stirred up. Let it settle before starting the filter up.

"I found this test kit easy to use and fairly simple. The kit tests for pH, high range pH (if you need it), Ammonia, Nitrite, and Nitrate. One complaint on earlier reviews was that the tests took too long. The most complicated test is for Nitrate, which requires a grand total of 6.5 minutes, of which 5 minutes are spent waiting for the results. So if you know how to set a timer, you spend very little time with the actual testing. I feel you get more accurate results than with the quick dip strips, and you probably get a lot more tests for your money. My biggest complaint is that the kit should include a pipette or dropper to transfer water from the tank to the little test tubes. If you dip them in the tank, you drip water and tend to make a mess. (Or maybe that's just me.) I bought a 5ml medicine dropper from the pharmacy for $2 and everything stays clean and dry.

"There are two reasons I thought it was a good idea to buy that pump. It was advertised as ""silent"", and it promised ""powerful aeration"". This pump gives out only 4.35psi pressure (on each nozzle, but pressure doesn't add up). I wouldn't call this ""powerful"". Notice how there is no mention of the pressure parameters in the product description. That's not really that important, or that bad, but the noise... The box features nice icon of a girl with her index finger by her lips, but in truth, she's probably gesticulating ""don't speak, I won't hear you anyway because this pump is so loud"". Really, this air pump is louder than my water pump, which is pretty loud all things considered. I'm seriously buying myself a dB level meter just to see what is Rena's definition of ""silent"". I estimate this pump produces at least 30dB of noise. I guess by now I should know better than to buy anything that says silent, but omits the noise level on the box or the technical sheet. And on top of all this, the check valve included with the pump *whistles*. I first thought that whatever -- the whistling will come out of the submerged terminators and would dissipate in the water, but it's still sometimes quite audible. I'm just glad my fish doesn't seem to mind.",fish aquatic pets

It's relatively moist for a gluten free cake. It's a bit chewy/spongy, but I didn't mind that. I've been gluten free long enough that I don't look for gluten free foods to be exactly like their gluten based counterparts. I enjoy good tasting gluten free foods for what they are.

The Vortex XL cleaned up the 125gal. tank in 12 hours to a crystal clear condition, that tank has never been that clear, ever. Some fish were dying in my 40 gal. tank, and I did not know why, I had just cleaned the tank and set it up. I had ran an outsider filter on the 40 gal. for several days before introducing any fish. After the death of several fish, I used the Vortex XL on that tank for about a day, or so, and I have not lost a fish since!! The 40 gal. is so clear, it is truly a pleasure to observe the fish-life.

"I was looking for a 5-ish gallon tank, and bought this item in the beginning of 2011. During the period of time that I was fishless cycling the tank, I realized how much I hated the design, and returned the tank.- the food door was too small- the filter was noisy compared to the filters I have now (AquaClear 20/50, Tom's mini filter, Duetto 100)- water only flowed through 1/2 of the filter cartridge- carbon was a permanent fixture in the filter, and it's not usually necessary in an aquarium(only really good for removing medication, it will also remove any fertilizer you add for plants)- the lighting seemed inefficient for growing even low light plants(I admit that I didn't keep it long enough to really find out)- [BIGGEST PET PEEVE] the hood had to be completely disassembled to access the inside of the tank+ first you remove the cover over the back half of the hood, which covered the filter+ next you had to remove the light+ then you had to remove the clear plastic cover that the light sat on- the need to remove the light to access the inside of the tank meant you couldn't see what you were doing- the clear plastic cover on the tank always had a ton of condensation, which made a mess on removal- in spite of the clear plastic cover, the light would still get some water on it",fish aquatic pets

"* This is a review for the 1.25oz Kickin' Teriyaki flavor Beef Jerky *Beef Jerky has always been one of my favorite snacking foods. I even used to make my own when I was younger. I've tried a variety of brands before but this is the first time trying out Wild Ride. It claims to be Hormone and Nitrate free with no added MSG, and while the ingredients listed do confirm their claims this beef jerky has got to be some of the driest, tasteless I have ever eaten.Kickin' Teriyaki is the flavor I got. To be sure I didn't just get a bad package I opened two bags and both sets of jerky was dry and tasteless. I do not taste anything ""kickin"" about this jerky and there is virtually no Teriyaki flavor either. To make things worse the dry jerky tends to have a powdery taste to it because it is made with Soy Sauce POWDER instead of Soy Sauce (this is to get around saying it has no added MSG). Instead of imparting a nice Teriyaki flavor you get this powedery taste to the jerky and mixed with the bit of onion and corn starch in the jerky, it almost is like they coated it with onion powder instead of Teriyaki.On the plus side however, this is a nitrate free product which is a good thing as many other jerkies tend to have Sodium Nitrate in them. Also with both packages I have opened currently, the jerky breaks down easily and isn't tough as leather nor does it contain any sinew it seems.OVERALL this jerky just seems extremely tasteless and powdery. While it doesn't contain ""added"" MSG, Nitrates or hormones, they got around this by using powdered versions of ingredients (powdered vinegar and soy sauce) plus it contains Dextrose and Fructose , modified food starch and corn starch and SUGAR is your second ingredient. I've never seen so much sugar and starch added to jerky in my life. So despite being hormone and nitrate free, this jerky (in my opinion) is barely palatable and should be avoided",snack food

"Better in than some, worse than others. The dial allows you to set the temperature and is good at keeping the temp. consistent which is great. However, aside from the actual heating is the construction. Because of its shape it will not work for a anything smaller than a 2.5 Mini Bow or for tanks w/o straight sides.This is not because you can't control the temp. finely enough, but because the large mounting piece needs to be above water, outside of the tank and attached to a straight edge. While the package does say non-submersible, I didn't think there would be so much of it that wasn't submersible, and the thumbnail for this isn't helpful at all. The water line is also very high. You will have to keep a careful eye on evaporation.Also, when the water temp. is close enough to cause the heater to shut off, there is a period of hesitation where the heater is almost on but not quite. When this happens, there is a buzzing sound. It reminds me of old horror movies when the characters turn on the bare bulb in the basement or in the defunct asylum.",fish aquatic pets

"I have used other brands as well but hagen got the only one which got 5 stars. Here is why..First of all it is very quiet. Not only the filter but the way water flows is also very smooth so you get less splash noise.Secondly I have a 50 on a 30 G tank. It is powerful. If you are having water clearness problems it Clears the water within a day. And you can control the water flow rate. I think you can slow the water down to %30 %40 ....Also the filter components are... well they are individual components. the sponge, carbon and bio media is separate. So if you are medicating your tank you can remove the carbon so that the drug you add does not get filtered.Or you can put other inserts like ammonia removing pellets instead of carbon pellets.. and so..The only downside of this filter is starting up after getting unplugged. Once the filter stops working for a reason( loss of power or after removing for maintenance)it won't not able to suck water from the tank at first. You have to add water from the top to start the circulation.Oh... one other thing.. I read some reviews saying the filter can push the filtration media up and overflow due to clogging of the sponge but this has never happened to me... I personally clean the filter every 2 to 3 weeks according to my test results. Never had any problems..I recommend this product .. I would buy it again.",fish aquatic pets

It's unfortunate, however, when the challenge of the puzzle arise more from poor construction rather than the actual difficulty of piecing it together.We always purchased Melissa and Doug floor puzzles in the past, but this regular sized jigsaw puzzle is a disappointment. I really had to force the pieces, which made it difficult to determine whether they really belonged together. Many pieces were bent, and the puzzle did not want to lay flat on the table. Pulling it apart was no simple matter either.

"I have had multiple hang-on-the-back filters in my experience with fish keeping. My favorite would be the AquaClear filters. They are good for clean to somewhat dirty fish, but any messy and or large amount of fish needs a canister filter. Even with an AquaClear 110 and 50, my water just simply wasn't as clear as it should have been. The ammonia, nitrates, and nitrites were all within parameters, but the water just wasn't crystal clear. The Cascade 1000 fixed that.Within 24 hours of setting it up, my water had gone from a slight haze to almost crystal clear. No beneficial bacteria had established itself in that amount of time but the large amount of media and high flow rate must have done it. I can only imagine that the water quality will improve with time because beneficial bacteria will be established.It is easy to set up. You will have to cut some hoses and slide some tubes together, but that is about it. The spray bar was a little too much for my 55 gallon. Kind of noisy. It created a lot of surface disturbance for oxygenation. I use the directional flow head instead. It also creates a good amount of disturbance but is noiseless. The filter is also noiseless when running. Of course, when you put your ear to it you can hear it, but behind a closed tank stand with air pumps running and slight trickling water, you can't hear it.It has three media baskets. The bottom came with a sponge with some filter floss, the second with more floss and carbon, and the third with more floss which I topped off with biomax media.Overall I am very pleased with this filter.",fish aquatic pets

Only problem with a betta fish is that I can't turn on the light because the fish will see its reflection and start to flare thinking there is another betta in the tank.

Even when the light isn't on, the sunlight at certain times of the day would do it... maybe a normal rectangular tank would be better for a betta fish. I can't quite give up the unique and stylish look of the hexagonal tank though. Plus it is a space saver. I'll just have to figure out how to fix the reflection issue.

"We hate to leave this kind of review especially when we have enjoyed this product so much in the past. Purchased this item in June 2011 and placed it in our kitchen cupboard upon arrival. Two weeks ago, we were watching a movie and decided to have some popcorn. Grabbed the new bag of Wabash (purple) and opened it. Moths came flying out of the bag. Yes, moths!! Quickly closed the bag and to our dismay saw many, many moths crawling around inside the bag. Did some internet research and found the moths are called Indian Meal Moths. We have never seen these critters in our kitchen before and are sure they came with the popcorn. We did a complete clean out of our cupboards and have not found them in any other products. We wrote an email to Wabash Valley thru Amazon about this incident two weeks ago and have heard nothing back.

As soon as I hooked this pump up to my 150gal filter systems I knew it could do the job. It not only ran on less juice than My previous German pump but pumped a higher volume of water. The slots on the pump housing however were narrower so it has plugged up a couple of times which amounts to a higher rate of plug-ups over time. I had hoped for a less blocking prone pump but I guess no one pump does it all. The German pump I had before lasted 7 years so it will be quit some time before I can rate this pumps longetivity but I am hopeful because the build quality seems good.

"These ""chips"" are really freaking good for being so healthy. The thing is, you have to know what to expect when you are eating a high protein/fiber product like this one. It is not going to taste like a potato chip so kiss that fantasy goodbye if that is what you are expecting. I suppose some people have extremely refined taste buds when it comes to chips and have a hard time stomaching these. But seriously, they are extremely good, even you don't care a whole lot about them being healthy. They are crunchy and crispy and have a good dose of flavoring on them, and they are not too salty.

The good news about the fat is that it is a plant based saturated short chain fatty acid, so your body can digest it efficiently.For anyone who isn't familiar with plantain, it is an Asian fruit, which like it's cousin, the banana, was introduced to the new world by 15th and 16th century explorers, such as the Portuguese and Spanish sailors, so calling them Inka Chips is interesting. For more than a year, I was looking for a good gluten-free cracker and I never considered a plantain chip as an excellent substitute until now, and shame on me, because I discovered them about twenty years ago. As a matter of fact, instead of making dumplings out of wheat flour, Puerto Ricans make them out of ground green plantains or bananas. I never ate plantain chips as a kid, but I did enjoy the plantain dumplings in soup; they were delicious and low in fat. Puerto Ricans also combine the ground plantain with other tropical tubers and stewed meats to make a huge dumpling that they boil in parchment paper in order to keep it intact while it cooks in a light brine; it's delicious and filling. At the West Indian markets in NYC, they sell plantain, banana, casava, and peanut flour. So, if you like to cook and experiment, you may want to make dumplings from such flours; I'm not a cook.The Inka chips are thicker than the plantain chips that I ate years ago, making them a suitable cracker substitute. I cover them with peanut butter or fruit preserves and enjoy them as a snack. I also crush them and add them to my bowl of soup in order to give the soup a nice crunch; these chips hold up well in liquid, better than Saltine crackers, with less salt.",snack food

"This product was a severe disappointment. I maintained this heater as I was supposed to--kept it at the proper water level, etc. A week after opening it, the product began to randomly turn off altogether--i.e. leave the water ice cold--or heat up to the point of being painful to the touch. Two weeks after opening the product, it began to sizzle in the tank. For fear that my fish would be hurt or electrocuted, I removed it from the tank and unplugged it. Five minutes after placing it on the floor, it started to smell like burning. I picked the product up and found a huge burn hole in my floor where it had been. The bottom of the heater exploded off. I managed to be able to pick the pieces up with a plastic bag after ten minutes of attempts. I was terrified that something in my room would catch fire. After this whole ordeal, my baby dalmatian molly, the only fish in the tank, died. I contacted the seller, and their response was an underwhelming, ""Well, you did it wrong."" They were unapologetic and unsympathetic about anything that transgressed, proceeding to outline what I did to cause this whole incident, even though I had done research and knew what I was doing. I am not pleased in the least with this purchase, and would never buy from this seller again, nor would I recommend them to anyone.",fish aquatic pets

"I purchased one of these about a year ago for a small, 2 gallon betta tank. The heater worked fine, kept the tank at an even 78 degrees in the winter and I was happy. In fact, I was pleased enough with my first purchase that I went ahead and bought another hydor mini for another 2 gallon tank. The second heater, externally exactly the same as the first, has run too warm since I first plugged it in. It is keeping the tank a consistent temperature, but it is keeping the tank consistently 15 degrees warmer than ambient room temperature (though the instructions says it will only heat the water about 8 degrees above room temperature, which is what I found with my first hydor mini). Right now, I have my room thermostat turned down a good 5 degrees more than I'd like to have it set at and I am still constantly worried that this heater is going to malfunction or that I'll wake up to an unseasonably warm winter morning and find my critters cooked. I've had the heater about a month and now I have no choice but to buy another heater (adjustable this time!) and a larger tank. Really wouldn't recommend this heater at all. Sure, some work, but some don't and, if you're like me, you'll have just blown about 10-15 dollars and spent hours worrying that your heater was going to malfunction.",fish aquatic pets

"There is the same product on another amazon page, but I ordered this item through from the company listed here. It's so amazing! The ornament looks really realistic, which is exactly what I wanted. I didn't want some bridge or roman columns because let's be honest, those items just look put of place in a fish tank. Not to mention in fish's natural habitat, those things don't actually exist. I wanted to create a comfortable and familiar environment for my fish.The ornament resembles that of a rock or wood, but it is not heavy like either! There are 3 small plants that grow out of the wood, the long plant is EXTREMELY realistic and graceful, it sways in the water. The shorter one is a fuller plant, creating contrasts. Lastly the shorter one is delicate looking but does not compromise its quality.All in all for $3.50, and that's how much I paid in total, since I am an amazon prime member, it's a STEAL! The company also packs the ornament very well! In lots of bubble wraps and air packets, so it will arrive safely to your door.I rarely leave reviews, I think this is my second one on amazon, but this product deserves a two thumbs up!Thank you!",fish aquatic pets
"After trying a bunch of different oatmeal (Steel cut, Irish, rolled, etc, etc) I have come to the realization that this is one of, if not the best breakfast oatmeal out there. At Amazon's price you really can't beat the 4 pack deal too.Overall the consistency of the oats is something you normally can't find, its a pleasant mix of steel cut texture (semi hard, bits) while still being like rolled oats (mushy)- once finished I like to add Bob's recommendations, milk and honey, which also helps cool it down. My own personal additions include a bit of cinnamon and brown sugar, though I use this sparing since part of the reason for making it is the protein content. At 6 grams per serving it's right up there with steel cut for oatmeal for high protein content. If you're a weight lifter who is looking to mix it up I'd recommend this all the way.

"this may not be the most powerful filter in the market but it really does an excellent job. i bought this for a small tank for my fish in my pond so that they can be indoor during the winter. the water is always crystal clear and doesn't stink. just make sure you always clean the foam filter and the propeller of the pump as it always have a lot of waste in it. if you can, make an extension of the pipe down to the bottom as this only includes one extension. you can buy a flexible pipe with the same diameter in your hardware store. the sound created by the waterfall largely depends on the height of the water in the tank. less water in the tank means more splashing sound. i just use the flow control during feeding time so that the food will not be sucked in to the pump other wise it is better to keep it fully open for optimized filtration, ""natural"" waterfall look and sound.",fish aquatic pets

I went to pull the box down today and discovered that 2 bags had opened at the top seam (or more likely had never properly been closed) and so had to throw them away. That bums me out, and it raised the overall cost of the remaining 10 bags about 50 cents each. Since I ordered the box over a month ago, I don't feel like I can request a refund, so my only advice is when you get your bulk package, don't just open the cardboard cutout and store it.

The bags say to cook for no longer than 2.5 minutes (that's 2 minutes, 30 seconds) and to stop if, before that, the popping slows down to a pop ever 2 seconds.I cooked about 10 of the bags and half of them burned through before reaching the limit, all while not slowing down the popping. One bag burned right through at about the one minute mark, with about 30 kernels popped. Butter-goo was all over the microwave. What a mess!I'm going to throw out the rest, because I'm terrified one will actually burst into flames.",snack food
"Being on a low carb/low glycemic diet, I shop around for low carb bars as meal replacement or snack option. I saw these bars at Kaiser Permanente (my HMO) and purchased them. 1) they are cheaper than other low-carb/no-carb bars out there, 2) they are actually quite tasty for being low-carb. I think a lot of people who are not used to low-carb protein bars do not have the experience with these types of bars, so they make comparison to regular bars out there that have upwards of 25 grams of sugar per serving. Of course sugar makes everything taste good, but that's definitely not my goal nor the goal of other low-carb eaters out there. We're looking for bars that don't have the same amount of sugar as a candy-bar (like Snickers), which a lot of other nutrition bars out there have. I give a five star rating, because compared to other low-carb bars, this is top notch.",breakfast foods
I love cinnamon and it works real good getting rid of spiders in your house. This was a great buy for me and the shipper got it to me before I was suppose to get it. Thank you !,cooking baking supplies
These are very tasty and fresh hazel nuts. I think they are the best ones I have had. Its hard to find dry roasted hazel nuts without any other nuts and these are just great.,snack food

"All I can say this is the best tasting popcorn we have ever tasted! It is so easy to use with the portion packs just pour and wait for great tasting popcorn! The only popcorn we ever buy, One taste and you will be a repeating customer like we have been for the past 4 years now.",snack food
We got these for a vacation and they were great for on the plane and in the diaper bag while on the go. Just perfect! We always have them on hand now.,baby food
"I was very disappointed in this product. The ingredients say that it contains either cornstarch or tapioca starch. The one I got used tapioca and that might have made the difference. The powdered sugar was like plaster, as another reviewer stated. It was very lumpy and my frosting never got the silky texture I've gotten for years with the cheap-o powdered sugars I bought in the supermarket.",cooking baking supplies
"Like other customers I divide these into handfuls in ziplock bags. They keep well and are not messy at all to eat (good for kids). Great for road trips, camping and hiking, or just snacking.",snack food
"Like that it's Organic but can find same item with that quality with larger quantity. My son likes the taste. It's an option for a dry snack or travel snack. So there are pluses, but the price for the small amount doesn't make it a total win.",baby food
Taste like sweet butter corn that melts in my mouth. I have given it to numerous of my students (just a taste) and many have loved it. It`s a healthy treat for my greedy boys at home also. LOL,snack food
Tastes good (something like broccoli - although I'm not a big fan of it) and it's healthy.A good replacement for the aged white cheddar (which is the best one)!,snack food
WHY AM I EATING A BABY BAR...YOU CUT THE AMOUNT IN THE PACKAGE SO CUT THE PRICE JEEZ. i like the brand but wow i have to eat 2 each time to be satisfied now. i think i will look for another company with grownup sizes.this one i ordered was a little chewy for some reason than last time...it was like eating a granola bar,breakfast foods
"Some of the reviewers eat these for weight control purpose, which I don't think that's what these bars are for. 20g protein bars like these are designed for muscle recovery after weight lifting workout. ThinkThin protein bars use whey protein isloate; which is the best protein for muscle recovery. I've been eating Cliff Protein bar for body building, although it's 95% organic but it has too much sugar. ThinkThin protein bars provide same amount of protein as the Cliff Bar with less sugar.These bars use sugar alcohol, instead of conventional sugar. Sugar alcohol is a sweetener commonly found in ""Sugar Free"" gums. It has less calories and doesn't cause tooth decay as conventional sugar does. Nonetheless, it's a sugar. I hope ThinkThin would start making these with organic ingredients.For those who are interesting in snack bars (instead of protein bars) for weight control,Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)are awesome.",breakfast foods

"So I bought these when I saw a great deal on deals.woot.com about a coupon they had and I had seen them in stores a few times but never took the plunge.These are tasty, although sometimes a little hard for my taste, and a little higher in calories than I would like in a snack (200 calories per bag)But, it does satifsy my sweet tooth nicely and is much better than candy or a donut, and easy to tuck in my gym bag or desk drawer. The single size is nice because it's easier to do portion control than counting out chips into a plastic baggie.Still on the fence if I would order again, but that's because of calories, not taste. Taste is great!",snack food
"If you like Amaretti, you we not be displeased with this product. They are expensive (they are a once-a-year purchse for me), but they're well worth it. I think the price also reflects the great tin the cookies come in. These babies just melt in your mouth and send you right to heaven.",snack food
"I am a big fan of Terra sweet potato chips for their nutrition and flavor, so I figured I would try the spiced chips. They aren't terrible, but something about the smell reminds me of body odor. I would imagine it is the cumin, so for some it might be an acquired taste.As for the packaging; They were delivered and left in the sun for a couple hours (we are currently having a 100+ heat wave) and 7/12 of the bags exploded in the box. I think Terra may put too much air in the bags.",snack food
"Some of the crackers were broken, but not too badly. The crackers themselves have a salty sweet balance that is wonderful! I love this product, super delicious.",snack food
So easy to make popcorn with these everything-in-on portion packs. All you do is load your popcorn machine with the premeasured amount of popcorn & flavored oil and you are good to go. Couldn't be any easier & tastes great too!,snack food
"Terra Chips really mess up Taro Chips. Actually all of their chips are usually over baked and burnt, broken up, and unevenly seasoned, bordering on bland. Do yourself a favor and try Hawaiichips.com! I just had my first serving of their taro chips. They are light, thinly sliced, evenly seasoned, and absolutely excellent! Not one burnt chip in the bag. Head and shoulders above Terra. What's more they come from Hawaii and are still cheaper than Terra. I promise you I am not affiliated with the company... just a staunch taro lover completely sick of trying to get Terra to care about their products and their customers!",snack food
Took very little of the colored gel to produce vibrant colors until the old standby dropper liquid food dyes that take the whole bottle and barely give the hue one needs for dying foods. I will definitely be buying this product again.,cooking baking supplies

This crispbread is nice and thin - great for those with more sensitive teeth.I eat 3 of these in the morning for breakfast with Smuckers Sugar-Free jelly on them.Guilt free and delicious.You do have to be a little careful when spreading heavy stuff on them like peanut butter.If you press too hard they can break.One thing you can't tell from the box is that there are actually 2 air-tight packs in the box.I'm currently eating these and the ryvita sesame rye crispbread.Highly recommend both.Note,snack food
"I am always looking for foods that have not been altered in any way. I am delighted to find this popcorn and I tested it by cooking it in 2 tablespoons of organic coconut oil in a stainless steel Great Northern popcorn popper that has a crank to keep the kernels moving in the popper. They all popped completely, and perfectly with this organic brand.I also taste tested a store bought version of yellow popcorn for comparison. As far as popping completely, this brand won. The store version had about 9 to 12 unpopped kernels left behind using the same method. There were also approximately 15 partially popped kernels left over with the store brand. There were none with this organic brand. The size of the popcorn were both equal, but the hulls were more noticeable with this brand, yet they didn't seem to get caught in the teeth any more or less than the other. Flavor was good, but not as flavorful as the store brand with nothing added to it. The texture was different from the store bought version as well. It was less ""light"" and a bit more chewy in texture. Nothing that would be noticeable at all for those who like the caramel version, or if you like to add salt and butter on your popcorn.I will be purchasing more of this brand. I was somewhat concerned about the packaging, but relieved to find that it comes with its' own ziplock sealer, so no need to store it in something else to keep it fresh. Hope this is useful in helping you decide to purchase. Enjoy!",snack food
Critical item for our household which includes severe food allergies. Best price out there! Strongly recommend this product if you have a young child with dairy allergies.,baby food
I ordered these based on the positive reviews on amazon as well as I had been satisfied by other products by Kay's naturals. I found the cheddar cheese taste to be ok but the problem was that over 50% of the crackers in the bag have been crunched and it makes it difficult to eat. I canceled my subscription to the crackers. The box arrived intact and well packaged but the inside items were still crushed.,snack food
"I was a little leery having to buy a box with 12 bags of popcorn. LOL! But I wasn't disappointed. I have to watch the salt intake and this has just enough salt (for me) to taste good and not enough to drive my blood pressure up. So health wise for me it is great. It won't compare to movie theater popcorn; but IF you love popcorn this is far better than my ""hot air"" popped corn that I try to ""add"" a little salt to and the salt falls off in the bottom of the bowl. I will definitely keep this on hand. Makes a great filling snack for the calories.September 20, 2012...I am towards the end of my 12 pack box of Bearito's Popcorn. I wanted to add that each bag is a very nice size and provides quite a few snacks for me. I am still very pleased with my purchase. It is almost time to order some more. :-))) So in the long run of things this has been economical for me. Personally...I am a happy camper!",snack food
"I purchased this for making fudge. I made 2 batches, one using the Callebaut dark chocolate and one using Bakers brand chocolate. In my unscientific blind taste test 2 out of 12 people preferred the Callebaut, the other 10 preferred the Bakers. All said the Callebaut was smoother and creamier, but most said the Bakers was more ""chocolaty"".The Callebaut was easier to measure and use (I didn't have to chop it up for quicker melting). Maybe using a 50/50 mixture of each will produce the quality between smoothness and chocolate that I want.",cooking baking supplies
